The majority of the narrators lived in the Lower East Side (LES)\n        neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. Other narrators include residents of the East Harlem\n        neighborhood of Manhattan; members of the Three Arrows Cooperative Society in Putnam Valley,\n        New York; veterans of the Vietnam War; and jazz musicians in New York City between 1940 and\n        1960. The narrators reflect the changing ethnic composition of different neighborhoods in\n        New York City, and include Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe; immigrants from Africa,\n        Asia, the Caribbean, and Central America; and migrants from the southern United States and\n        Puerto Rico. Topics covered by the interviews include life in tenements in the LES, life in\n        public and cooperative housing in the LES, family life, ethnic identities, intercultural and\n        interracial relations in New York City, education, religion, paid and unpaid work,\n        immigration and migration experiences, religious and social activities in East Harlem, Asian\n        American activism, socialist and anarchist organizations, political activism, anti-war\n        movements, community gardens in New York City, and experiences of women in higher education\n        through the 1970s and 1990s. In addition to the interviews, the collection includes\n        transcripts (full and partial) of interviews, notes on and indexes of interviews, field\n        notes taken by interviewers, and preliminary questionnaires completed by narrators. Some\n        files include articles and ephemera created by the narrators or are related to the topics\n        they discussed in the interviews.",

The narrators reflect the changing ethnic\n        composition of different neighborhoods in New York City, and include Jewish immigrants from\n        Eastern Europe; immigrants from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Central America; and\n        migrants from the southern United States and Puerto Rico. Topics covered by the interviews\n        include life in tenements in the LES, life in public and cooperative housing in the LES,\n        family life, ethnic identities, intercultural and interracial relations in New York City,\n        education, religion, paid and unpaid work, immigration and migration experiences, religious\n        and social activities in East Harlem, Asian American activism, socialist and anarchist\n        organizations, and political activism. In addition to the interviews, the collection\n        includes transcripts (full and partial) of interviews, notes on and indexes of interviews,\n        field notes taken by interviewers, and preliminary questionnaires completed by narrators.\n        Some files include articles and ephemera created by the narrators or are related to the\n        topics they discussed in the interviews."

The interview covers Barkin's childhood in\n              the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, her family, and her experiences\n              at settlement houses in the LES. Barkin recounts her memories of life in the LES in\n              the 1930s and 1940s, describes her family's apartment on Willett Street, and the\n              apartment in the LES she shared with her mother after her parents' divorce. She\n              discusses her parents' divorce and her relationship with her parents after their\n              divorce. She describes her parents' occupations, her mother's work as a machine\n              operator, and her father's work as an undertaker. Barkin describes her mother's\n              family, the family's opinion of her father, and Barkin's estrangement from them. She\n              discusses the importance of the LES settlement houses to her and her friends and her\n              memberships in the Educational Alliance, Madison House, Stanton Street Settlement,\n              Christodora House, University Settlement, and Lavenberg House. She recounts attending\n              dances at all of the settlements and after-school activities at the University\n              Settlement and the Educational Alliance. She discusses meeting her husband, her\n              reasons for marrying him, and his occupations."

The interview covers Mildred Barlow's\n              childhood, her family, and her experiences in the Vladeck Houses in the LES. Barlow\n              often switches from topics with little transition. She discusses her childhood,\n              including apartments in which her family lived and food she would buy. She recalls the\n              deaths of her father and her brother. She discusses her separation from her husband\n              and her relationship with her children."

The interview covers Beck's\n              experiences as the Director of the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side\n              (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and as Executive Director at the Mobilization for\n              Youth in the LES. Beck discusses his education and his family, including his work in\n              the Merchant Marine before entering college and his parents' involvement with the\n              Henry Street Settlement. He discusses his cooperative jobs while a student at Antioch\n              College in Ohio and the fact that these led to his interest in social work. He\n              describes the youth development programs at the Settlement and recounts the creation\n              and mission of Mobilization for Youth. He discusses Helen Hall, her philosophy of\n              social work, and her involvement in the creation of Mobilization for Youth. He\n              recounts a strike by Settlement staff in 1965 and the division this led to between the\n              Settlement, Mobilization for Youth, and other organizations in the LES. He describes\n              the differing approaches to social work between the Settlement and Mobilization for\n              Youth and the communities each served. He recounts becoming the Director at the\n              Settlement and issues he faced directing both the Settlement and Mobilization for\n              Youth. He compares his relationship with Helen Hall with her relationship with Lillian\n              Wald. Other topics include Beck's experiences on an unspecified New York City school\n              board and ethnic and racial tensions in the LES.

The interview covers Behrend's childhood, her\n              training in violin at the Juilliard School in Manhattan, her career as a violin\n              teacher at Juilliard and the Music School at the Henry Street Settlement in Manhattan,\n              and her role as an early adopter of the Shinichi Suzuki method of violin instruction\n              in the United States. Behrend relates her early interest in music, her family's\n              musical background, and her introduction to the violin at ten years old. She recalls\n              studying violin at the Universität Mozarteum Salzburg in Austria and at the Institute\n              for Musical Art in New York. She discusses auditioning at Juilliard in 1939 and her\n              time there over the next three years, including the teachers, the other students, and\n              the course of study. Behrend discusses her decision to become a violin teacher; her\n              years teaching at the Henry Street Settlement with Grace Spofford, Robert Egan, and\n              Ivan Galamian; and her students at Henry Street. She recalls her decision to leave\n              Henry Street and her introduction to Shinichi Suzuki and his method of teaching\n              violin. She describes the Suzuki method and how she applied that method at Henry\n              Street and the School for Strings.

The interview covers Mollie Bomse Berkowitz's early life in the Lower East\n              Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and her family. She describes the\n              apartments in which her family lived on Willett Street and her neighbors in the\n              buildings. She discusses classes and events she would attend at the Grand Street\n              Settlement and the Educational Alliance in the LES. She discusses her religious\n              education and her instruction at the Downtown Talmud Torah in the LES. She discusses\n              games she would play as a child and recounts renting bicycles with friends and riding\n              along the East River Drive in Manhattan. She recalls having to wear camphor around her\n              neck during a polio epidemic when she was a child. She discusses observing Jewish\n              holidays and customs surrounding them. She discusses stores and customs in her\n              neighborhood, including people renting space in a shoemaker's space to store their\n              baby carriages and eating out at a delicatessen once a week. Other topics include her\n              husband, trips to Coney Island in Brooklyn with her family, and her parents moving to\n              Queens in the 1950s."

The majority of the interview covers Anne Binder's childhood experiences in\n              the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. Binder recalls living\n              in a railroad style apartment on Scammel Street in the LES with her parents, prior to\n              the birth of her siblings. She explains that two boarders lived with the family,\n              making for a crowded living environment. Binder describes assisting her mother with\n              the family's laundry. Binder recalls her family moving from Scammel Street to Madison\n              Street in the LES and the apartments' similar railroad floorplans. She recalls sitting\n              on the fire escape while her mother gave birth inside their apartment for each of her\n              three siblings, due to the small size of the apartment and lack of privacy. Binder\n              describes shopping with her mother at the pushcarts and local butcher for groceries\n              each day."

The interview covers Bert Bloomgarden's family and his work in the jewelry\n              business. Bloomgarden recounts his father-in-law starting Belenky Brothers and\n              Bloomgarden becoming involved in the business after his marriage. He discusses the\n              changes in the LES between the 1930s and the time of the interview, including the\n              types of businesses that were there and the changes in the ethnic demographics of the\n              neighborhood."

She discusses household chores, her father helping out with chores,\n              and meals her mother would prepare. She recounts attending a Yiddish theatre on 2nd\n              Avenue with her family and lists performers and shows they saw.

The majority of the interview covers Breskin's childhood, his first\n              job and Jewish family life in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. He\n              discusses the prominence of wholesale and retail businesses in the Lower East Side\n              during the 1930s-1960s. Breskin describes the interrogation he received when applying\n              for his United States citizenship in the 1920s. He concludes his interview stating\n              that he does not see any future in wholesale and retail in the Lower East Side, but\n              hopes that he is wrong."

Breskin and his mother immigrated to the\n              United States around 1920 to rejoin his father in Paterson, New Jersey. The family\n              moved to the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. His father worked as\n              a painter and his mother maintained the family apartment on Broome Street. He attended\n              Public School 12 (PS12). As a teenager, Breskin sold candy and soda outside a\n              burlesque theatre on Grand Street. He left high school and began working to support\n              his parents. Breskin worked as a salesman and in 1937 opened a wholesale business on\n              Orchard Street. He was a member of the Wholesale Dry Goods Workers Union and the\n              Freemasons."

Breslow discusses growing up on the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of\n              Manhattan, New York; her relationship with her family; and her participation in\n              Hashomer Hatzair. Breslow describes playing in tenement hallways and in the streets of\n              the LES. She discusses the fact that her parents were older than the parents of other\n              children her age and how she worried as a child that they would die. She describes her\n              relationship with her older siblings who were born in Poland; she describes being\n              inspired by her older sister who returned to college and learned to swim later in\n              life. Breslow discusses the reasons she enjoyed belonging to the Hashomer Hatzair,\n              including folk dancing and the perceived seriousness of the youth group. She describes\n              her preference for Brooklyn over the LES because of its spaciousness and greenery."

He recalls his parents being strict and\n              preferring to spend time at his friends' homes because their parents were less strict.\n              Bucholz discusses attending the Woodstock Music \u0026 Arts Fair in 1969 in Bethel, New\n              York. Bucholz states that his father was a quiet man and the two of them mostly talked\n              about the family business."

The majority of the interview covers Luba Kadison Buloff's\n              experiences as a Yiddish theatre actor and her acting experiences in Europe and the\n              United States (US). Buloff recalls growing up in the acting world and traveling\n              throughout Europe to perform for various Jewish communities. Buloff states that after\n              immigrating to the US, she continued to act, that her entire life was related to\n              theatre, and that she did not socialize outside of the troupe. Buloff described 2nd\n              Avenue in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York as lively due to the\n              large volume of Yiddish theatres and high attendance of each show. She explains that\n              by the 1940s, she thought that the Yiddish theatre had become too commercialized,\n              which led her to move to Chicago, Illinois. Buloff explains that she felt that the New\n              York Yiddish theatre became less about the art of acting and more about profits and\n              fame."

The interview covers Canin's family and experiences\n              at the Music School at the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side neighborhood\n              of Manhattan. Canin recounts his introduction to the piano and the Music School at the\n              Henry Street Settlement. He discusses his teachers at the Henry Street Settlement,\n              Aurelio Giorni and Robert Scholz, and elaborates on his relationship with Scholz. He\n              discusses his family, including the instruments each member played and his\n              relationship with his brother, Stuart Canin. He discusses Rosemary Younker; her\n              patronage of the Music School; her sponsorship of him, which allowed for his\n              attendance at the Meadowmount School of Music in Lewis, New York; and his relationship\n              with her son, Herman. Other topics include his experiences as a student at the\n              Juilliard School in Manhattan and in the United States Army Band during the Korean\n              War.

The majority of the interview covers Beatrice\n              \"Betty\" Dagstine's enjoyment of living in the Vladeck Houses. Dagstine recalls living\n              in a tenement building in the LES with her parents, where the bathtub was in the\n              kitchen and the shared toilet was out in the hallway. She remembers playing kick the\n              can with neighbors when she was child. She recalls the LES neighborhood as being safe\n              and she said she rarely locked her apartment doors. Dagstine describes structure of\n              The Women, a women's club at the Henry Street Settlement in the LES, including the\n              dues structure, the meeting schedule, and the fact that it was a social club offered\n              by the Henry Street Settlement."

The\n              interview covers Rose DeAngelo's family and working life. DeAngelo discusses her\n              childhood, including the apartments in which her family lived and the fact that her\n              mother had 15 children. She discusses the death of seven of her siblings as infants,\n              causes of infant mortality in the early 20th century, and the death of her father. She\n              describes her siblings, their careers, and their families. DeAngelo and her husband\n              recount their wedding and their 50th and 60th anniversary celebrations. Sam DeAngelo\n              discusses discipline in school and at home, his working life, and his and Rose's\n              reasons for staying in the LES. Rose DeAngelo discusses different jobs she had in an\n              unspecified hat factory, at the American Steel Wool Manufacturing Company factory, as\n              a tomato packer at an unspecified factory, and as a seamstress in an unspecified\n              garment factory in the LES. She explains that she and her friend were strike breakers\n              in the hat factory and her opinions of labor unions before and after this experience.\n              She discusses the custom of having midwives attend at home births, her mother's four\n              sets of twins, and their mortality rate. DeAngelo describes her work as a seamstress\n              at Post Manufacturing Company on Lafayette Street, including the types of athletic\n              clothes she made, the decline of the business, and working conditions in the factory.\n              She describes the apartments in which she lived in the LES and sections of the\n              neighborhood, including Worth Street and Mulberry Street Park. Other topics include\n              military service of DeAngelo's family members, crime in the LES in the 1910s and at\n              the time of the interview, Italian residents of the LES, and benefits of her\n              membership in an unspecified labor union (likely the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of\n              America)."

The interview is difficult to hear,\n              due to a lot of background noise. The majority of the interview covers Dell's\n              childhood experiences growing up in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan and\n              owning Katz's Delicatessen. Dell explains the rules of box baseball, stickball,\n              punchball, kick the can, and marbles. He recalls having to pause in the middle of\n              stickball games to allow cars to drive past the game. Dell describes why Katz's\n              Delicatessen is popular, stating his belief that maintaining their same means of\n              operation, menu, location, and food preparation have all attributed to the\n              delicatessen's continual success."

Dell's parents were born in the\n              Lower East Side. All of Dell's grandparents immigrated to the United States from\n              Russia. In 1952, Dell's family moved into a two bedroom apartment in a cooperative\n              building on Grand Street. His father owned a restaurant and bar called Club 28 in the\n              East Village neighborhood of Manhattan. At 10 years old, Dell got his first job at a\n              butcher shop on Grand Street. Dell earned two master's degrees in music and special\n              education and worked as a teacher for several years. In 1988, Dell's father purchased\n              Katz's Delicatessen on East Houston Street."

The interview covers Deutsch's early life in the\n              Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and her family. Deutsch\n              describes the apartment in which her family lived on Cannon Street in the LES, the\n              family's living arrangements, and their neighbors. She discusses the family's customs\n              surrounding the Jewish holidays, including games she would play and food her mother\n              would make. She recalls attending classes and events at the Clark House and the Grand\n              Street Settlement in the LES. She recalls family members visiting her family's\n              apartment. She discusses belonging to the Downtown Talmud Torah and participating in\n              clubs and classes in the Educational Alliance in LES. She recounts her father's\n              responsibilities as a cohen in a synagogue. Other topics include stores in her\n              neighborhood, performers she saw at the Yiddish theatre, her religious upbringing, and\n              her extended family."

The interview is primarily with Nellie Dick and\n              her son, Jim Dick, occasionally participates. The majority of the interview covers\n              Nellie Dick's recollections of anarchist communities in London, England; New York; and\n              New Jersey. Dick recalls attending a lecture given by Johann Rudolf Rocker in London\n              when she was eight or nine years old and being the only child present at the lecture.\n              She explains that her immersion into politics at a young age resulted in her dedicated\n              involvement in the anarchist community. Dick goes into detail about what she considers\n              to be the fundamental differences between anarchists and Communists, one being the\n              belief that there should be a bit of a hierarchy to the working and social structure\n              of a community. She describes teaching herself to read Yiddish and her eagerness to\n              learn. Dick recalls working closely with her fellow principals at the Modern School to\n              write the , a Stelton Colony\n              publication. As leaders of the Ferrer Colony, Nellie and her husband each proposed and\n              carried out projects to better the community, including better living conditions for\n              the boarding school students and improvements to school buildings. She explains that\n              not only did the students attend classes at the school, they were also responsible for\n              maintaining the grounds of the school. Dick describes teaching her students manners as\n              she strongly believed in etiquette and discipline. Dick expresses her adoration for\n              the Stelton Colony and her pride as a contributing leader of that community, as she\n              was a proponent of always improving the community. She also explains the colony's\n              mission, which expresses the importance of responsibility in order to have freedom,\n              and the living atmosphere of the Ferrer Colony. Dick explains that she knew she\n              belonged within the Ferrer Colony because she shared the outstanding belief that there\n              should be a change in government and that all individuals should receive an\n              education.",

Dornfest\n              discusses her family's apartments in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of\n              Manhattan, on Eldridge and Clinton Streets. She describes both apartments, the living\n              arrangements, and the ways in which the family members negotiated privacy for\n              themselves. She describes the University Settlement in the LES and programs in which\n              she participated there. She recounts games she and friends would play in the street.\n              She discusses her father's work as a milliner before the Great Depression and as a\n              salesman and barber during and after the Depression. She discusses his background,\n              including his education and early life in Poland, his decision to immigrate to the US,\n              his participation in pinochle and chess clubs in the LES, and his death when she was\n              14 years old. She recounts her mother's decision to work as a seamstress in order to\n              supplement the family's income. She discusses her mother's background, including her\n              family in Russia and the immigration pattern of her father and siblings. Dornfest\n              discusses a social club she and her friends organized, named Club Yremus, including\n              the friends who belonged to the club and the activities in which the group\n              participated. Other topics include Dornfest's education, family members who lived in\n              Palestine, and her brother."

Eisner describes the apartments in which her family lived in the LES, in\n              particular their apartment on Goerck Street. She discusses her family's traditions\n              around the Jewish sabbath, including having a non-Jewish person conduct chores for\n              them during the sabbath and the foods her family would eat. She recounts using public\n              bathhouses and discusses the family's neighbors and neighborhood traditions\n              surrounding Jewish holidays and funerals. She discusses her education, including\n              attending the Downtown Talmud Torah in the LES and Washington Irving High School in\n              Manhattan. She discusses her family, including her parents' relationship with her\n              mother's widowed sister and the fact that her husband did not want her to work outside\n              of the home. She recalls speaking only Yiddish in the home until she attended school,\n              at which time she and her sisters spoke English amongst themselves."

Rebecca Epstein discusses the fact that her teachers in New\n              York loved her Boston accent while her classmates derided it. She describes the layout\n              and furnishing of her family's railroad apartment in the Lower East Side (LES)\n              neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and discusses her family's practice of taking on\n              boarders who were recent immigrants. She describes immigrants entering the United\n              States through Castle Garden in Manhattan. Epstein discusses the deaths of three of\n              her siblings, two of whom died from infantile cholera, or summer complaint. Epstein\n              discusses her relationship with her father, in particular his attitude of superiority\n              towards her mother and how his perceived hypocrisy led to Epstein's decision to become\n              an atheist. Epstein also discusses childhood activities for earning money such as\n              completing piecework and charging admission for plays organized by neighborhood\n              children."

Feldman discusses the shared class\n              experience of people who lived in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan,\n              New York. She describes sharing bathrooms and throwing trash out of windows as typical\n              for the neighborhood during her youth. Feldman discusses the importance of education\n              for upward mobility and neighborhood organizations such as Workmen's Circle,\n              Educational Alliance, Madison House, and Henry Street Settlement. She discusses peers\n              that have moved away from the LES and how the neighborhood has changed."

Ida Fier describes her childhood and adolescence in the Lower East Side\n              (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. She describes witnessing her father's death\n              of a heart attack and her embarrassment at her mother's subsequent decision to become\n              the janitor at their 232 Rivington Street apartment. Fier discusses her relationship\n              with her mother, in particular her support of Fier's desire to attend college and\n              their conflict over Orthodox Judaism. She describes feeling unable to discuss abortion\n              and menstruation with her mother. Fier describes the importance of local institutions\n              such as the Henry Street Settlement and the local library for entertainment and\n              education. She describes doing schoolwork at the public library when there were guests\n              at home, going to school during the summer to learn basket and rug weaving, and taking\n              piano lessons at the Henry Street Settlement. She discusses the limited enforcement of\n              quarantines in the LES. Fier discusses joining the Communist Party of the United\n              States of America in college and being a student teacher at Seward Park High School.\n              Fier discusses the impact of nostalgia on accounts of the LES by her generation,\n              arguing that people are sentimental about their youths because their lives had more\n              potential."

The majority of the interview covers Deborah Borgenicht Flynn's memories of\n              her family, in particular her father, Louis Borgenicht. Laist asks questions regarding\n              passages from Harold Friedman's biography, t, and asks Flynn for confirmation and details about\n              certain stories. Flynn recalls accompanying her father to his garment factory,\n              Borgenicht and Spiro, Inc., in Manhattan, New York. She describes her father's work\n              ethic, but cannot recall specific details regarding his business. Flynn recalls\n              visiting the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan at a young age with her\n              mother and bringing food to poor Jewish families. Flynn describes the tenement\n              buildings in the LES as very crowded and dirty and compares this to her experiences in\n              the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.",

Fox describes his family's\n              apartment in the LES and their neighbors. He recalls a beer hall near their apartment\n              and songs the customers would sing. He discusses traditions in his family surrounding\n              Jewish holidays, in particular Passover and Hanukah. He discusses his relationship\n              with his mother, including her cooking and her insistence on home remedies and\n              medication used by their Italian neighbors. He discusses events in the LES during\n              election time, including bonfires and candidates' speeches. He discusses his sisters\n              having to work in the family's store and their resentment at the fact that he did not\n              have to work in the store. He recalls attending Hebrew school and participating in\n              events and activities at the Boys' Club, the Victor Athletic Club, and the Christodora\n              House, all located in the LES. He describes street games he and his friends would play\n              and recounts going to the Peter Jarema Funeral Home in the LES with his friends in\n              order to view the bodies."

The majority of the interview covers Estelle Lieberman Friedman's\n              experiences as a child in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New\n              York. She describes the layout of the family's apartment on Ludlow Street in the LES,\n              including the shared toilet in the hallway. Friedman recalls the apartment being\n              converted to electric power when she was three years old. She discusses having an\n              operation as a young child and states that it was performed by a neighborhood doctor\n              on her kitchen table. She recalls the doctor running electricity from the hallway in\n              order to use the necessary medical tools for the surgery. Friedman recalls playing on\n              the fire escape during the summer and neighbors gathering to sit on the building\n              stoops. She describes the abundance of pushcarts in the LES that sold various food\n              items and dry goods."

Gold discusses her education, family, and her knowledge of the\n              Henry Street Settlement before she worked there. She recounts her excitement in\n              starting to work for the Settlement in 1955 and discusses becoming the Director of the\n              Fiscal Office, including staff she hired and differences in the office before and\n              after she became the Director. She discusses grants the Settlement received while she\n              was the Director of the Fiscal Office and new programs that were established through\n              these grants, particularly youth programs. She discusses the creation of Mobilization\n              for Youth, its relationship with the Settlement, and staff members of the Settlement\n              who also worked at Mobilization for Youth. She discusses other programs at the\n              Settlement aimed at educating children and teenagers about alternatives to gangs. She\n              discusses Directors of the Settlement, including Helen Hall, Bertram Beck, and Daniel\n              Kronenfeld. Other topics include programs for homeless people and children of People\n              with AIDS, the Settlement as leader in social program initiatives, and the Board of\n              Trustees at the Settlement."

The interview covers Sylvia Groen's early life and family. Groen explains\n              that her mother would take her and her siblings to visit her grandparents and aunt in\n              the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. She describes the apartments\n              in which they lived. She describes her grandparents and aunt, including their\n              backgrounds, her grandparents' decision to immigrate to the United States (US), and\n              her grandfather's work as an egg peddler in the US. She discusses her grandmother's\n              fear of the outside world and the fact that her grandfather took over the household\n              chores because of this. She discusses the experiences of her aunts and uncles who\n              immigrated to the US from Russia after World War I and the Russian Revolution. She\n              discusses her relationship with her grandparents. Groen discusses her father's work\n              history during the Great Depression, his shame at not always having a job, and the\n              family's shame at having to accept home relief benefits. She explains that life\n              improved for her family during World War II. She describes her family's apartments in\n              the Bronx, the fact that her father built all of the furnishings himself, and her\n              parents both creating decorations in the apartments."

The interview covers Pearl Weiss Handman's childhood in the Lower East Side\n              neighborhood of Manhattan, New York; her family; and her social activities. Handman\n              recounts her family's life in their apartment behind her father's dry good store and\n              the household responsibilities of each family member. She discusses the ethnic\n              composition of the Lower East Side and the peddlers, entertainers, and gangsters in\n              her neighborhood. Handman discusses learning to type in high school in order to have a\n              skill when she graduated, working for a publishing company after high school, and\n              belonging to the United Office and Professional Workers of America. She recounts\n              attending dances, concerts, and other events at settlement houses."

The interview\n              covers Harris's early life in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and\n              her family. Harris discusses the death of her mother when she was six months old and\n              her father's second marriage when Harris was four years old. She describes her\n              family's apartments on Broome and Monroe Streets in the LES, the neighborhoods around\n              each apartment, and the family's living arrangements. She discusses her dislike of the\n              public baths, particularly having to bathe with strangers. She discusses attending the\n              Madison House summer camp when she was eight years old and remembers the differences\n              between life in the LES and in the country. She discusses attending events and\n              participating in activities at settlement houses in the LES, in particular the Madison\n              House and an unspecified settlement house on Hester Street. She describes events and\n              customs in the LES surrounding local and national elections. She discusses becoming\n              aware of politics, including joining the American Student Union at Seward Park High\n              School in the LES and attending events in Union Square in Manhattan on May 1. She\n              discusses her family, including her relationship with her stepmother and the fact that\n              her stepmother did not want anyone to know that she was not Harris's mother. Other\n              topics include vermin in the family's apartments, her relationship with her extended\n              family, and ways in which the family members negotiated privacy for themselves in\n              their apartments."

The interview covers Herman's experiences at the Music\n              School at the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of\n              Manhattan. Herman discusses his parents, their immigration experiences, and their\n              careers. He discusses his education at an unspecified yeshiva in the Williamsburg\n              neighborhood of Brooklyn and describes Williamsburg. He recounts his first experiences\n              in the LES and compares the LES and Williamsburg neighborhoods in the 1950s. He\n              discusses studying the violin at the Music School with Louise Behrend, recalls his\n              memories of his first days at the school, and describes the building in which the\n              school was housed on Pitt Street in the LES. He describes Behrend and her philosophy\n              of teaching violin. He discusses other students at the school, the level at which they\n              were expected to perform, and his participation in the School's orchestra. He\n              discusses his Jewish identity in terms of the time he spent in Williamsburg and in the\n              LES, and the conflict he perceived in expectations of him in the two neighborhoods. He\n              discusses his friends at the School and performances of the orchestra in which he\n              participated.

She describes in detail\n              her neighbor who raised Holtzman while both of her parents worked. She recalls the\n              crowded apartment buildings in the LES and describes her neighbors. She discusses in\n              detail her passion for singing and her lack of interest in school. Holtzman discusses\n              participating in the Loew's Theater Singing Contest in the early 1930s and performing\n              as an adult at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan and Shea Stadium in Queens.

The interview covers Kalawsky's early life\n              in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and her family. Throughout the\n              interview, Kalawsky describes her family's apartments in the LES, living arrangements\n              in the apartments, appliances in the apartments, the ways in which the family members\n              negotiated privacy for themselves in the apartment. She discusses her parents'\n              responsibilities as the janitors in the buildings in which they lived. She discusses\n              her mother, her jobs outside of the home, and her feelings about working outside of\n              the home, in particular her enjoyment of discussing politics with her coworkers. She\n              discusses her father's work for the City of New York as a watchman on construction\n              sites. She discusses her parents' relationship and their immigration experiences. She\n              discusses her Irish neighbors, a Catholic church in her neighborhood to which she\n              wanted to belong, and the fact that she wanted to be Irish rather than Russian.\n              Kalawsky discusses the death of her oldest sister from spinal meningitis when she was\n              seven years old and her mother's feelings about illness in the family after the death\n              of her daughter. She discusses her relationship with her parents, the fact that her\n              mother worried over her safety and the games and skills her father taught her. She\n              recalls her memories of the different ethnic groups that lived together in the LES, in\n              particular the foods of each group and her opinion that the diversity was beneficial\n              to the people living in the neighborhood. Other topics include traditions in her home\n              during Easter and Christmas and games she would play with her friends."

The interview covers Michael Katz's life in the Lower East Side\n              (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and his involvement in the Henry Street\n              Oldtimers at the Henry Street Settlement in the LES. At the beginning and end of the\n              interview, Katz discusses the work of the Henry Street Oldtimers at the Henry Street\n              Settlement and members of the Oldtimers. He discusses the reasons for the creation of\n              the Oldtimers in 1938 and the importance of the Henry Street Settlement to him, his\n              friends, and his brothers as children. He discusses his role as president of the Henry\n              Street Settlement Federal Credit Union and recounts the creation of the credit union.\n              He discusses his childhood in the LES, his reasons for joining the Henry Street\n              Settlement, and activities in which he participated there. He discusses his father's\n              working life, the family's living arrangements in small apartments in the LES, and his\n              parents' immigration experiences. He discusses his education, his dislike of school,\n              and his preference for meeting friends in pool halls rather than attending school. He\n              recounts his family's reaction to his brother's marriage to a Catholic and the fact\n              that his mother would not speak to him for two years after his marriage. He discusses\n              organizations in which he was involved at the time of the interview and his volunteer\n              work through the Henry Street Settlement and an unspecified Masonic lodge. Other\n              topics include his siblings and his work as a salesman."

The interview covers Katz's childhood, her\n              family, and her working life. Katz discusses her parents, including her father's many\n              jobs, her parents' divorce, and her father's relationship with Katz and her siblings\n              after the divorce. She discusses her marriage, including childbirth and her decision\n              to use birth control. She discusses living with her mother and other family members\n              after her marriage and the ways in which people negotiated privacy for themselves\n              while living in close proximity with many family members. Katz recounts social\n              activities in which she participated as a child and young woman, and with her husband\n              after their children were older. Other topics include her children, her husband's\n              jobs, her involvement in the Flushing chapter of Hadassah, and her religious\n              views."

Kertman describes the LES as very crowded and\n              explains that he thought the majority of the residents had become Americanized and\n              that he felt excluded because of this. Kertman discusses his feelings about this\n              Americanization and he disapproval for the immigrants who, in his opinion, had\n              abandoned their home country's language, attitude and general way of life. He explains\n              that he found purpose and community within the Communist Party of the United States of\n              America because they were activity in the community and stood for causes that he felt\n              would better society."

The interview covers Philip Kiriakos's\n              childhood, family, and experiences as a tenant of the Vladeck Houses. He describes his\n              daughters and discusses the deaths of his elder daughter in 1983 and his wife in 1988.\n              He recounts learning about the Vladeck Houses and being one of the first families to\n              move into the apartments. He discusses the differences between life in the tenements\n              and Vladeck Houses, including having bathrooms inside the apartment and having rent\n              determined by the occupants' salaries. He discusses crime in the Vladeck Houses and\n              other housing projects at the time of the interview and his opinion that the Vladeck\n              Houses are better than other housing projects. He discusses his neighbors and his\n              decision to stay in the Vladeck Houses because of his relationship with one family. He\n              recounts life in the tenements in the 1910s and 1920s, including Christmas and New\n              Year's traditions, trolleys in front of the buildings, and ways to keep cool in the\n              summer. Other topics include his participation in a theatre group at the Church of St.\n              James in Manhattan and different jobs he held."

Koblenz assisted throughout the\n              interview by an interpreter from the League for the Hard of Hearing in Manhattan and\n              is sometimes hard to understand.

Kokofsky describes the\n              apartments in which his family lived in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan\n              and the living arrangements in them. He describes his father's work as a laborer at\n              the , or . He discusses a kheyder he attended near Suffolk and Attorney\n              Streets, the corporal punishment inflicted on the students, and his refusal to return\n              after receiving a beating. He discusses his and his siblings' education and their\n              leaving school in order to work to support the family. He discusses his childhood\n              friends and his feelings about non-Jewish people as a young person. He discusses his\n              participation in a choir in an unspecified synagogue, despite the fact that his family\n              were not strictly observant. He describes his parents and discusses his relationship\n              with them, in particular his negative feelings about his mother and his preference for\n              his father. He discusses his membership in the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store\n              Union when he worked in the garment industry and his membership in the American Postal\n              Workers Union when he worked for the United States Postal Service. Other topics\n              include the family's experiences during the Great Depression, his siblings' working\n              lives, and his friendships with Zero Mostel and his brother that developed in the\n              synagogue choir.",

Landres explains that his father\n              purposely injured himself in order to be discharged from the Russian Army and that the\n              family immigrated to the United States soon after this event. Landres recalls his\n              memory of being met at Ellis Island, New York by his cousin. Landres expresses the\n              hardships he faced as he began to learn English. He discusses his experiences playing\n              stickball with his neighbors and founding a Wilson Club, likely in support of Woodrow\n              Wilson's candidacy for president in 1916. There are no details provided about the\n              mission nor functions of this organization.

She recounts the living arrangements in their apartments and the boarders who\n              rented a room in their apartments. She discusses the death of her father, his funeral,\n              and her mother's reaction to his death. She describes her mother, in particular her\n              resourcefulness in raising her children after the deaths of both of her husbands. She\n              describes her neighbors in the LES and her mother's relationship with some of the\n              neighbors. She recounts having diphtheria four times as a child and her apartment\n              being quarantined when she was sick. Other topics include the jobs her mother held\n              after the death of Levinson's father, traditions in her family around Jewish holidays,\n              and her extended family."

The interview covers Sadie Levy's\n              experiences as a resident of the Vladeck Houses between 1940 and 1982. Levy compares\n              the Vladeck Houses when she first moved in and when she left, including the residents,\n              the rent, and maintenance. She discusses her participation in programs at the\n              Educational Alliance in Manhattan and her preference for the Educational Alliance over\n              the Henry Street Settlement. She compares her work and salary as a machine operator\n              and in an unspecified position for the City of New York. She describes her parents,\n              her brothers, and her neighbors at the Vladeck Houses."

The interview covers Lipkin's early life in the Lower East\n              Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and her family. Throughout the\n              interview, Lipkin describes her family's apartment on Cherry Street in the LES, the\n              living arrangements in the apartment, and the family's neighbors. She discusses her\n              father, including his work for a grocer as a driver of a horse and wagon and his death\n              when he was 57 years old. She recalls peddling fly paper, candles, and other items\n              with her siblings in the LES before school and her mother's work plucking chickens in\n              order to support her father's income. She discusses traditions in her family\n              surrounding the Jewish sabbath and holidays, including her father and brothers\n              attending shul, her father and his friends sharing a meal on the sabbath, and she and\n              her family attending services at a synagogue on Madison and Clinton Streets in the\n              LES. She discusses her parents' membership in the Workmen's Circle in Manhattan and\n              events they would attend there. Other topics include Lipkin's friends in the LES and\n              trips to Coney Island in Brooklyn with her family and neighbors."

Mandel describes the apartments in\n              which his family lived in the LES and general living conditions in the neighborhood.\n              He describes the schools he attended and some of his experiences at school. He\n              discusses the death of his father leading him leaving high school, taking the civil\n              service exam, and working in the United States Postal Service. He compares the\n              different apartments in a tenement building, the different rents and benefits for each\n              apartment, and which ones were the better apartments to have."

The interview covers Markowitz's early life\n              in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and her family. Markowitz\n              discusses her parents, including their immigration experiences. She describes the\n              apartments in which her family lived in the LES, including the layouts, the amenities\n              and utilities, and the living arrangements in the apartments. She discusses social and\n              leisure activities in which she participated in the LES and recalls attending summer\n              camp outside of New York City. She discusses her experiences during the Great\n              Depression and her feelings about her family having to accept home relief benefits and\n              the way in which her family was viewed because of this. She discusses organized crime\n              in the LES and her friends who became involved in organized crime. She discusses the\n              apartments in which she lived with her husband and their children and recounts her\n              reasons for moving from the LES to Long Island. She recounts the deaths of many of her\n              family members, including her first husband, in 1982. She describes herself as a happy\n              person despite the difficulties she faced throughout her life. She describes her\n              brothers, their military service during World War II, and her relationship with them.\n              She discusses one of her uncles, her dislike of him, and his relationship with her\n              father. She recalls her memories of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg before and after their\n              trial and execution, her opinions on their case, and the ways in which the community\n              in the LES reacted to their conviction and executions."

The interview covers Marrin's\n              experiences as a member of the Board of Directors at the Henry Street Settlement in\n              the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and her working life.\n              Marrin discusses the beginning of her involvement with the Henry Street Settlement as\n              a volunteer in the Drama Department and Pete's House Productions working with Joseph\n              Balfior. She discusses ethnic and racial tensions in the LES and the ways in which the\n              staff of the Drama Department sought to teach the children and teenagers how to\n              resolve them. She recounts her idea to coordinate the drama, dance, and music programs\n              as a unified arts program at the Settlement and the fact that this led to her\n              invitation to join the Board of Directors in 1966. She explains that she became\n              involved in fundraising activities, continued with her drama classes, and worked as a\n              nurse until she had children and no longer had time to dedicate to volunteering. She\n              recounts her decisions to leave her nursing position in 1973, to become a lobbyist in\n              Albany for a state senator for ten years, and to enroll in law school at Pace\n              University in Manhattan. She discusses the creation of the Settlement's Art Show\n              between 1987 and 1989 and her idea to have it at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan.\n              She describes Jimmy Robinson, the head of the Youth Program, and his Cavaliers\n              program, and the leader of the Youth Program at the time of the interview. Other\n              topics include the creation of the Settlement's Urban Family Center and Arts Center,\n              her experiences as a lobbyist, and the Friends of Henry Street."

The interview covers Miller's life in the Lower East Side (LES)\n              neighborhood of Manhattan and his family. Miller discusses his parents, their\n              immigration experiences, and their working lives. He describes his family's apartment\n              in the LES, the layout, and the amenities and utilities in the apartment. He recalls\n              home remedies his mother would use, his opinion of doctors, and he and his brother\n              being quarantined for diphtheria. He describes his father's work as a carpenter, his\n              carpentry business, and his customers. He discusses the schools he attended. He\n              describes the ethnic boundaries in the LES, the fact that he and his friends were\n              careful of staying in the Jewish sections of the neighborhood, and animosities between\n              Jewish, Italian, Russian, and Polish residents of the LES. He recounts his\n              relationship with his father and the differences between parenting in the 1920s and\n              1930s and at the time of the interview, in particular the importance placed on fathers\n              spending time with their sons in 1990s. He describes his work as an electrician with\n              his brother after his graduation from high school and after his discharge from the\n              Navy after World War II. He discusses his career as a sales manager for a brick\n              company. He recounts activities and events he attended at settlement houses and states\n              that he would never attend events at the University Settlement as it was located in\n              the Italian section of the LES. Other topics include his relationship with his\n              siblings, his experiences in the Navy during World War II, shopping in the LES in the\n              1930s and 1940s."

The\n              majority of this interview covers Mitch Miller's research on twentieth century\n              anarchism in New York, specifically in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan,\n              as well as in Europe. He discusses the decline of the Yiddish language, the Spanish\n              Civil War, and compares anarchism in the period between the 1950s and 1970s to\n              politics in the United States (US) at the time of the interview. Miller describes the\n              Lower East Side to be located below Fourteenth Street and East of Second Avenue. He\n              references the book, Fragments, written by Sam Dolgoff throughout his interview and\n              relates that Dolgoff played an active role in the anarchist movement during the\n              twentieth century in the Lower East Side (LES). Miller explains the tension between\n              various ethnic groups in the LES, including gang fights between Jewish, Irish, and\n              Italian residents and relates his opinion that between 1900 and 1940 neighborhoods\n              were the center of people's lives."

Cotton at the Classic\n              Coffee Shop in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. The\n              interview covers Carmine Morales's family and his working life. Morales discusses his\n              parents and his paternal grandfather's disapproval of their marriage. He recounts the\n              schools he attended, after school jobs he had, social activities in which he\n              participated, and the ethnic demographics of the LES. He recounts working at a summer\n              camp at Bear Mountain in New York managed by the Educational Alliance and meeting his\n              wife there. He discusses working in restaurants in New York, before taking over the\n              Classic Coffee Shop in the LES from his father. Morales describes the differences in\n              the neighborhood around his coffee shop between when his father owned and at the time\n              of the interview, as well as his customers and the food he serves."

The interview covers Lorraine Cohen\n              Nussenblatt's family and her experiences in different housing projects in New York\n              City. Nussenblatt recounts moving into the Vladeck Houses with her mother and two\n              siblings in 1940 as one of the first residents. She discusses her family's reasons for\n              moving to the Williamsburg Houses in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn and\n              then to the Vladeck Houses, and describes the two housing projects. She discusses\n              social activities at the Educational Alliance in the LES, including dances, Hebrew\n              classes, and sewing classes, and states that she still attended events there at the\n              time of the interview. She discusses her duties as an air raid warden during World War\n              II and as an officer in the Vladeck Houses Tenants Association at the Vladeck Houses.\n              She discusses an informal loan association provided through the Vladeck Houses Tenants\n              Association. She discusses the activities in which she participates through the Good\n              Companions Senior Center at the Henry Street Settlement in the LES. She discusses her\n              parents, including their immigration to the United States, their meeting at an\n              unspecified socialist club in New York, and her mother's struggle after her husband's\n              death."

The interview covers Nora O'Malley's childhood in\n              Ireland, her family, and her experiences as a cook at the Henry Street Settlement in\n              the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. O'Malley can sometimes\n              be hard to hear. She describes her family and her childhood in Ireland, including her\n              house and chores, her siblings, and her relationship with her parents. She recalls\n              social and leisure activities in the village near her family's farm and Christmas and\n              birthday traditions. She discusses the differences in cooking when she first came to\n              the Henry Street Settlement in the 1930s and later in her career, specifically having\n              machines to assist in peeling and cutting vegetables and frozen foods. She recounts\n              different apartments in which she lived in the LES before she moved into 267 Henry\n              Street, one of the buildings managed by the Henry Street Settlement, and describes her\n              apartment. She describes the other cooks with whom she worked, their responsibilities,\n              and types of meals they cooked. Other topics include Helen Hall and Thanksgiving at\n              the Henry Street Settlement. See also: Beck, Bertram; Gold, Leona; McGee-Robinson,\n              Audrey Peters"

The majority of the interview covers Helen\n              Pearl's early life in Romania and her lack of happiness throughout her life. Pearl\n              recalls her mother struggling to financially support the family after her parents'\n              divorce. She reflects negatively on her childhood, the time during which she lived\n              with her uncle, and her lack of education. Pearl explains that she married her husband\n              not for love, but to start a family. Throughout the interview, Pearl is extremely\n              emotional and expresses great sadness about her life as a whole. She recalls finding\n              it difficult to work in addition to raising her children. Pearl describes finding\n              comfort with the Jewish population in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan\n              and missing that sense of community when she moved to the Red Hook neighborhood of\n              Brooklyn."

Platin discusses living in a tenement on East Broadway in the Lower East\n              Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, which she remembers as being in better\n              condition compared to other buildings in the LES. She describes moving to\n              Knickerbocker Village in the LES. Platin discusses services provided by the Henry\n              Street Settlement in Manhattan during the Great Depression, such as food stamp\n              distribution, assistance with the Department of Welfare (likely a city department),\n              and organizing boat rides for mothers and children in the summer. Platin discusses the\n              deaths of relatives in Poland during pogroms and illnesses experienced by family\n              members, including diabetes and tuberculosis. She talks about her sadness over the\n              death of her maternal grandmother when she was five years old, and discusses Jewish\n              customs and practices surrounding death. Platin discusses living in Brooklyn as a\n              young mother and the careers of family members."

Laist at Bernard Rosen's\n              house in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. The majority of the\n              interview covers Rosen's childhood in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.\n              Occasionally, Rosen's wife, Elizabeth Rosen, can be heard correcting him. Rosen\n              recalls living in dumbbell tenement on Henry Street that had both internal plumbing\n              and heat. He recalls living around the corner from his paternal grandparents and\n              remembers weekend family meals at their apartment. Rosen recalls his grandmother\n              keeping fish in the bathtub in the kitchen before cooking them. Rosen discusses his\n              father's grocery store and it being closed by the city in order to build the Mayor\n              Fiorello H. LaGuardia Houses. He talks about his negative experiences at Catholic\n              school and his acceptance into the Intellectually Gifted Children Program at Public\n              School 33 (PS33). Rosen recalls spending time at the Lower East Side Garden Cafeteria\n              and Union Square to attend political talks and rallies."

His grandfather owned a tailor shop on East Broadway, his father owned a grocery\n              store, and his mother was an embroiderer at a local shop. Rosen attended a Catholic\n              school on Henry Street until the fifth grade.

The\n              majority of the interview covers the immigration of Rosen's maternal grandparents and\n              their life experiences in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. Rosen\n              describes how her maternal grandfather left his parent's home at 12 years old and\n              traveled across Poland and Russia. She discusses her grandmother's success as a\n              seamstress making children's pinafores and dresses in the Lower East Side and how this\n              success led to the family's children's clothing factory. Rosen states that her\n              grandfather started the concept of standard children's clothing sizes. She describes\n              her grandfather as an idealist, who believed strongly in the capitalist system and the\n              business opportunities it presents."

The majority of the interview covers Schatsky's childhood\n              and life in a Jewish household in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.\n              Schatsky recalls moving from 253 Henry Street to 254 Henry Street and his opinion that\n              the latter was more modern because it had a bathroom inside the apartment rather than\n              in the hallway. He describes feeling a sense of inferiority when he would accompany\n              his mother on her trips to the welfare office during the 1930s and 1940s. Schatsky\n              states that the street and the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side provided\n              space for the neighborhood children to play together. He also discusses his\n              philosophical opinions about being Jewish, the importance of friendship, and his love\n              for New York City. See also Julius Schatsky's interview."

About half of the second track of the recording is blank. The interview covers\n              Jacqueline Schmidt's early life in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan\n              and her family. Schmidt describes apartments in which she lived and in which her\n              family members lived in the LES, including the neighborhoods, the amenities and\n              utilities in the apartments, and living arrangements in the apartments. She discusses\n              living with her grandfather in order to care for him between 1949 and 1955, and\n              describes the apartment in which they lived on Third Street in the LES and the chores\n              for which she was responsible. She describes the apartment and neighborhood in which\n              her mother and stepfather lived on Avenue C at Sixth Street in the LES and the\n              different pushcarts that were outside their apartment. She discusses traditions in her\n              family around Easter and Christmas, the fact that Czechoslovakian and Italian\n              traditions were combined, and her favorite traditions for each holiday. She explains\n              the reasons why she moved between family members, first living with her mother and\n              stepfather and then her grandfather in the LES, moving to the Woodside neighborhood of\n              Queens to live with her father, and returning to the LES to live with her mother when\n              she attended high school. She discusses her education and after school activities in\n              which she participated, in particular basketball. She discusses her parents' divorce,\n              their second marriages, and the fact that she moved between their households. She\n              describes her relationship with her parents and activities they would do together.\n              Other topics include a comparison of life in the LES between the 1940s and at the time\n              of the interview, one of her maternal aunts who performed in a carnival, her extended\n              family members, and her memories Yiddish theatres in the LES."

The majority of the\n              interview covers Norman Shapiro's family's winery. Shapiro recalls thousands of people\n              lining up outside the winery during Passover in order to purchase wine. He states that\n              since the opening of their store, his family made and sold their own wine. Shapiro\n              explains that he was 12 years old when he first started working at the family winery\n              in order to assist with bottling the wine. He suggests that, at the time of the\n              interview, the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan had changed from a primarily\n              Jewish neighborhood to include people from Puerto Rico and China. Shapiro argues that\n              people were happier during the 1940s and 1960s because their families lived closeby\n              and were able to share in traditions like the Passover seder. He expresses his opinion\n              that the LES has been affected negatively with the shift of immigrant populations."

Sylvia, a friend of Shulman's whose first name is not\n              given, occasionally participates in the interview. Throughout the interview, Shulman\n              shows Groen awards he received, posters he created, and photographs. Shulman discusses\n              his parents' immigration experiences and describes his family's apartments on Houston\n              Street in the LES. He recounts the amenities in the apartments, living arrangements,\n              chores for which each family member was responsible, the fact that his father's sign\n              shop was in the basement of one of their apartments, and his memories of the food\n              store Russ \u0026 Daughters which was on the ground floor of one of the buildings in\n              which they lived. He discusses his education and career, his work creating posters for\n              theatres in New York City, and his decision to teach commercial art. He recounts\n              posters he created for the Academy of Music on Fourteenth Street in Manhattan, Yiddish\n              and other theatres, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and the National\n              Broadcasting Company (NBC). He relates stories about his students at George\n              Westinghouse Vocational and Technical High School in Brooklyn. He discusses his\n              father's sign shop and businesses for which he created signs. He describes saloons in\n              the LES and recounts buying beer for his father from a saloon near his apartment. He\n              discusses contentious relations between Jewish, Italian, and Irish residents of the\n              LES, including fights he had with Italian children in the LES. Other topics include\n              awards Shulman won at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, a fire in a leather factory\n              in the LES when Shulman was a child, anecdotes about the LES, and organized crime in\n              the LES."

The majority of the interview covers Celia\n              Solomon Silverman's early life in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New\n              York. Silverman recalls immigrating to the United States from an unspecified European\n              country with her older sister to live with their two brothers in New York City. She\n              describes their two room apartment and its marble fireplace. Silverman talks about\n              using the public baths once a week and shopping daily for groceries. She mentions\n              attending Yiddish literature lectures at a community center and meetings at the\n              Workmen's Circle in Manhattan with her brothers and friends.

She recounts\n              her parents selling their candy store and finding employment in the shoe and garment\n              industries. She discusses her father's health and its impact upon the family's diet.\n              Other topics include the Yiddish theatre, traditions in her family around the Jewish\n              holidays, and her participation in the Emanuel Brotherhood on Sixth Street in the\n              LES."

Berman at Rose Singer's\n              apartment in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. The interview\n              covers Singer's experiences in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and\n              at the Henry Street Settlement in the LES, particularly as a member of the Alcott\n              Club. Singer describes the Vladeck Houses in the LES and recounts moving there in\n              1940. She discusses her membership in the Alcott Club at the Henry Street Settlement,\n              her participation in other events and activities at the Settlement, and her friends at\n              the Settlement. She explains that she developed confidence through these activities at\n              the Settlement. She discusses her early life in the LES, her unhappiness at moving to\n              the neighborhood as a teenager after the death of her father, and compares the LES\n              with Yonkers in the 1920s and 1930s. She recounts her early working life in the early\n              1930s as a children's clothing inspector and the working conditions in the factory in\n              which she worked. She discusses her parents and the ways in which her mother supported\n              the family after her husband's death in 1927. "

She discusses the\n              settlement houses' social programs and the ways in which they benefited the LES. She\n              discusses the sense of community she felt at the Henry Street Settlement and the\n              freedom she felt being away from her young children and her husband for a short time.\n              She explains that her husband at first resented her involvement with the Settlement,\n              his resentment at having to care for their children while she went out, and her\n              resentment of his leisure activities and the double-standard that existed in their\n              family. She describes holiday activities at the Settlement, in particular the fact\n              that the different ethnic and religious groups at the Settlement would work together\n              to create inclusive events before Irish and Italian members formed separate groups\n              based on ethnic identities. She describes the Settlement programs in which the Alcott\n              Club took a particular interest, including working for better housing in the LES, a\n              cooperative milk program, and clothing swaps. Other topics include her memories of the\n              Great Depression, discussion of her husband's working life, and her memories of Helen\n              Hall."

Sipser\n              discusses his memories of life on Rivington Street in the LES, including the\n              apartments in which his family lived on Rivington Street, meals his mother would\n              prepare, and how illness was treated in his household. He recounts customs surrounding\n              funerals, election days, and Jewish holidays and events. He recounts helping with his\n              parents' tomato pushcart and playing punchball and marbles with his friends."

A second interview\n              was conducted on April 7, 1993 by Halvorson at Solomon's house. The main topics of the\n              interviews include Solomon's knowledge of members of the Vanguard Group, an anarchist\n              political group active during the 1930s in New York City and her experiences living in\n              the Ferrer Colony in Stelton, New Jersey. Solomon recalls her parents hosting\n              gatherings at the family's apartment on Avenue B and Twelfth Street in the Lower East\n              Side neighborhood of Manhattan at which anarchism and the Modern School Movement were\n              discussed. She discusses her parents' decision to join the Ferrer Colony and describes\n              the house her parents built in the Colony. Solomon recalls her physical education\n              teacher, James Dick, and her enjoyment of soccer and basketball as a child. She\n              reflects fondly upon her life at the Colony and states that the community evoked an\n              atmosphere of freedom."

The Solomons discuss the role of anarchism as well as Anarchy's\n              presence during world events like, the Spanish Civil War."

Laist at Sally Spiro\n              Stern's apartment in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. The\n              interview includes both audio and video recordings. The majority of the interview\n              covers Stern's memories of her family, in particular her grandfather, Louis Borgenicht\n              and her father, Jack D. Spiro. Stern's description and opinions of her grandfather\n              differ from what is expressed in Harold Friedman's biography of him, . She argues\n              his book describes him as a positive, fair minded, and hardworking man when he was\n              actually very unpleasant and cold. Stern also argues that it was her grandmother who\n              had the successful business ideas, not her grandfather. She explains the emphasis on\n              Jewish traditions in her family, including family dinners, marriage, and the\n              importance of education. Stern recalls the sense of community amongst Jewish people in\n              the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. She describes her first experience of\n              anti-semitism at the University of Michigan in the mid 1940s.",

The interview covers Mollie Stiker's early life in the Lower East Side (LES)\n              neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. Stiker describes the neighborhood in which she\n              lived near East Fourth Street in the LES and the apartment in which she lived. She\n              discusses the amenities and utilities in their apartment, the layout of the apartment,\n              and stores in which her mother would shop in their neighborhood. She recounts\n              traditions in her family around the Jewish holidays and discusses her extended family.\n              She recounts her family's eviction from one of their apartments. She discusses her\n              mother's worries over the safety of her children and the fact that Stiker and her\n              siblings were sometimes not allowed to participate in activities because of their\n              mother's worry."

The interview covers Gussie Stolzenberg's childhood\n              in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan. Stolzenberg recounts her\n              family's frequent moves throughout the LES in order to save money, furnishings in\n              their apartments, and boarders living with the family. She recalls speaking Yiddish at\n              home and learning English when she started school. She discusses the way illness was\n              treated in her household and her family's membership in a landsmannschaft that\n              included two burial plots and covered her father's funeral costs. Stolzenberg\n              discusses her enjoyment of reading and the Yiddish theatre."

The majority of the interview covers Beverly Fischer Weinstein's childhood\n              experiences being raised by her widowed mother in the Lower East Side (LES)\n              neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. She vividly describes the family's apartment on\n              Madison Street in the LES apartment and the fact that it was an entire floor of the\n              building and a railroad style apartment. Weinstein discusses the fact that their\n              apartment was near her family's leather business. She discusses her friends' reactions\n              to her apartment and to the LES and their comparisons between the LES and the\n              neighborhoods in which they lived in upper Manhattan. Weinstein recalls visiting the\n              Educational Alliance and being a member of the Young Israel Synagogue of Manhattan.\n              She discusses the importance of family; weekly Sunday visits from relatives who lived\n              in Newark, New Jersey; and her participation in many weddings. She expresses pride in\n              her education and work experiences and explains that she was glad she waited until she\n              was about 30 years old to get married. Weinstein states that she enjoyed her\n              independence and argued that it allowed her to gain meaningful experiences which she\n              might not have been able to have if she had gotten married and started a family at an\n              earlier age."

After the death of her father when Weinstein\n              was two years old, her mother managed the business and raised her five children.\n              Between 1937 and 1955, the family lived in a three bedroom apartment on Madison Street\n              in the LES. She earned her bachelor's degree in sociology and psychology from City\n              College in Manhattan. Weinstein worked as a psychiatrist at Elmhurst Hospital in\n              Queens.

The majority of the interview covers Weiss's immigration experience, his\n              experience owning a business, and his opinions on differences in the Lower East Side\n              between the1960s and the time of the interview. Weiss discusses the difficulties he\n              faced getting his immigration papers. He remembers having to travel around Russia for\n              the required documents and physical examination. Weiss recalls purchasing the space\n              that became his wholesale and retail business. He states that the ethnic demographics\n              of the neighborhood had changed from predominantly Jewish and Eastern European in the\n              1960s to Chinese and Hispanic at the time of the interview. Weiss shares his opinion\n              that the growth of department stores in the Lower East Side has increased at the time\n              of the interview and was hurting local businesses."

Both of his parents\n              died at the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, and his only brother died at an\n              unspecified concentration camp. In 1941, Weiss was imprisoned in a Russian labor camp.\n              Weiss immigrated to the United States in 1953. He lived with his uncle in the Lower\n              East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York before moving to the Williamsburg\n              neighborhood of Brooklyn. Weiss's first job was in a leather jacket factory on Hester\n              Street in the Lower East Side. He later worked for his uncle, who was a wholesaler and\n              distributor of underwear. Around 1960, Weiss opened his own wholesale and retail shop\n              on Orchard Street in the Lower East Side."

Farrell Williams discusses his parents' decision to migrate from New\n              Orleans, Louisiana to the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. He\n              recalls his father's opinions about living in the northern United States (US) versus\n              the southern US. Williams remembers his paternal grandmother living with the family on\n              Grand Street and how his mother took care of her as she had diabetes. Williams talks\n              about shopping in the Chinatown neighborhood of Manhattan in the 1960s and recalls\n              experiencing racial discrimination. He recalls attending an Ike and Tina Turner\n              concert at the Apollo Theater in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan. Williams\n              discusses attending church at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. Williams talks\n              about the sense of fellowship he felt at this predominantly African American church\n              congregation. He discusses working for the Merchant Marine and how the Seafarers'\n              International Union of North America, Atlantic, Gulf, Lakes, and Inland Waters\n              District helped to improve working conditions over the years."

The majority of the interview covers Natalie Zuckerman's childhood and Jewish\n              family life in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. She discusses\n              her mother's determination to become a United States citizen and recalls her mother\n              attending night school at the Henry Street Settlement in the LES and accompanying her\n              mother to her citizenship test in 1929. Zuckerman describes attending shows at Yiddish\n              theaters on Second Avenue, occasionally purchasing French chocolates at an ice cream\n              parlor on Second Avenue and spending time in the public library. She recalls\n              frequently shopping for fresh food and dry goods with her mother on Orchard Street.\n              Zuckerman relates a detailed story about witnessing her mother having her fortune read\n              in the LES. She recalls her extended family living in the LES and spending the\n              Saturdays together in celebration of the Sabbath. She discusses the types of food the\n              family would prepare together, like potato pancakes topped with sour cream or\n              applesauce. Zuckerman recalls taking dance lessons at the University Settlement House\n              in the LES and accounts a special occasion when Eleanor Roosevelt acted as the dance\n              instructor one evening. She states that after the death of her husband she had started\n              writing her memoir."

Zweibach\n              describes the apartments in which her family lived in the LES, the amenities and\n              utilities, the layouts, the living arrangements, and the ways in which the family\n              members negotiated privacy for themselves. She describes her relationship with her\n              brother, in particular her resentment of him when they were children and their\n              relationship at the time of the interview. She discusses her father's jobs, including\n              losing his work as an egg candler when machines were introduced to do that work, and\n              his work as an unskilled laborer in various temporary jobs. She discusses her family's\n              finances while her father could not find permanent work, her parents becoming janitors\n              in one of the buildings in which they lived, and the shame of having to receive home\n              relief benefits during the Great Depression. She recounts gaining a job as a summer\n              school teacher in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens through the Works Progress\n              Administration. She describes her mother, including her relationship with her brothers\n              and her feminism, which Zweibach credits for her receiving a college education and\n              becoming a professional. Other topics include her jealousy over her brother's\n              religious education, her love of the public library and reading, and her membership in\n              the Workmen's Circle in Manhattan."

The narrators include residents of the East Harlem neighborhood of\n            Manhattan, New York; Asian American activists; Central American, African, and Caribbean\n            immigrants who settled in New York City in the 1980s and 1990s; members of the Three\n            Arrows Cooperative Society in Putnam Valley, New York; and residents of public and\n            cooperative housing in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. The narrators who\n            lived in East Harlem were members of the East Harlem Protestant Parish, stickball\n            players, or were involved with the Young Lords activist organization. The East Harlem\n            Protestant Parish interviews cover the founding of the church and its work in East\n            Harlem. The stickball interviews contain discussions of different forms of stickball\n            popular in East Harlem through the 1940s and 1960s and amateur and professional\n            stickball teams in New York City from the 1940s to the time of the interview. The\n            interviews conducted with Asian American activists cover their participation in\n            political and social movements, including Asian Americans for Action, Harlem Parents'\n            Committee, and the Organization on African American Unity. These interviews include\n            discussions of the narrators' experiences in the internment camps in the western United\n            States (US) during World War II and of discrimination. The interviews with Central\n            American, African, and Caribbean immigrants include discussions of immigration\n            experiences, comparisons of life in the US and the narrators' countries of origins, and\n            discrimination experienced by the narrators in the US. The majority of the Central\n            American narrators were Nicaraguan or lived in Nicaragua in the 1970s and 1980s, and\n            relate their experiences of the Nicaraguan Revolution between 1979 and 1990. The members\n            of the Three Arrows Cooperative Society (3A) in Putnam Valley, New York describe the\n            community and its principles and their participation other political and social\n            organizations, including the Young People's Socialist League and the Workmen's Circle.\n            The Young Lords interviews discuss the history and activities of the organization in New\n            York City in the 1970s and 1980s."

Akiya\n                discusses the experience of being Japanese American, his education in Japan, his\n                career, and his participation in civil rights movements in the United States (US).\n                Akiya describes the discrimination experienced by Japanese people in the US,\n                including anti-immigration laws and internment camps during World War II. He\n                discusses his experience as one of the kibei, Japanese Americans who left the US for\n                schooling in Japan. He discusses traveling to Washington, DC in order to get a job\n                with the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. Akiya describes moving to\n                New York City and working at a Japanese bank where he observed discriminatory hiring\n                practices against blacks and latinos. Akiya describes working as a finisher in a\n                furniture factory and becoming a union representative (likely in the United\n                Furniture Workers of America). Akiya discusses his involvement in both civil rights\n                and anti-nuclear movements; he discusses trying and failing to see Malcolm X on the\n                day he was murdered and going to anti-apartheid meetings in the Harlem neighborhood\n                of Manhattan, New York. He describes receiving the Martin Luther King, Jr. Award for\n                Community Organizing."

                                            "Karl Akiya was born in San Francisco, California in 1909. His father was a chef\n                from Yokohama, Japan who immigrated to the United States (US) in order to learn how\n                to cook American food. Akiya's mother immigrated to the US from Japan after her\n                marriage was arranged with Akiya's father. Akiya was the oldest of three children,\n                and had one brother and one sister. His parents sent Akiya and his siblings to Japan\n                for their education in 1915. Akiya returned to the US in 1932, giving up his dual\n                Japanese citizenship, in order to escape being drafted into the Japanese Army.\n                During World War II he was interned at the Topaz War Relocation Camp in Utah. Akiya\n                worked at two banks, the Office of Strategic Services, a furniture store, and at the\n                University of Michigan as a Japanese teacher. In 1987, Akiya received the Martin\n                Luther King, Jr. Award for Community Organizing."

Iijima\n                discusses her family background and history of political activism in Asian groups.\n                She discusses her parents' work running a Japanese-language newspaper in the\n                Chinatown neighborhood of Oakland, California. She describes her mother's mix of\n                feminism and traditionalism. She describes her first political action, picketing a\n                Young Men's Christian Association for discrimination against people of color, while\n                a student at the University of California, Berkeley. She discusses the difficulty of\n                finding a job for Japanese Americans, leading many college graduates to work as\n                maids. She describes moving through the internment camp system and later to Camp\n                Shelby in Hattiesburg, Mississippi during World War II. She discusses being shocked\n                by the racism faced by African Americans in Mississippi, and recounts a story in\n                which a bus driver opposed her giving up her seat to pregnant black woman. She\n                discusses moving to New York City to be with her sister while her husband was\n                overseas during World War II. She discusses her involvement with the Japanese\n                American Committee for Democracy on 52nd Street in Manhattan, New York, including\n                editing their newsletter. She describes participating in anti-Vietnam War protests\n                and the inspiration it gave her to start Asian Americans for Action (AAA) along with\n                her friend, Minn Matsuda. She discusses the United Asian Communities Center through\n                AAA and their solidarity with other political and ethnic identity groups including\n                the Young Lords. She describes the relationship between Asian groups on the East and\n                West Coast, including the ethnic studies movement based at San Francisco State\n                University. She discusses the dissolution of the Asian Movement in the late\n                1970s."

                                            "Kazu Iijima was born in 1918 in Oakland, California, one of three daughters. Her\n                parents met after emigrating from Japan; her father attended the University of\n                California, Berkeley, and her mother traveled to California after the end of her\n                first marriage. Iijima's father started a Japanese-language newspaper in which her\n                mother published poetry. Iijima attended the University of California, Berkeley.\n                During World War II, she was moved first to the Tanforan Assembly Center in San\n                Bruno, California and then to the Topaz Internment Camp near Delta, Utah. She\n                married her husband, Tak Iijima in Salt Lake City, Utah. Iijima followed her\n                husband, who was in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, to Camp Shelby in Hattiesburg,\n                Mississippi, where she worked in the United Service Organization. In 1945 or 1946\n                she moved to New York City and edited the Japanese American Committee for Democracy\n                newsletter. In 1948 she gave birth to a son and a daughter. Iijima was active in\n                protesting the Vietnam War and co-founded a political group, Asian Americans for\n                Action, in 1969 with Minn Matsuda."

He recalls the early years of his seminary\n                field work in East Harlem and his involvement in the community's youth ministry as a\n                youth group administrator. He describes in detail a speaking tour of universities in\n                the southern United States in which he participated in February 1960. He recounts\n                preaching sermons and administering youth bible study groups of interracial groups\n                of students during the speaking tour.. Mercedes Ortiz's interview was conducted on\n                October 9 and October 22, 1995. She discusses her childhood in Puerto Rico and her\n                family's farm. Ortiz discusses her mother's management of the farm and describes the\n                process of making cheese. Ortiz describes her involvement in the Church of the Son\n                of Man and the fact that her knowledge of English and Spanish allows her to\n                contribute to the community through her translation of sermons. Throughout the\n                interview she stresses the importance of her faith and the fact that it provided her\n                with inner strength. Buffy Calvert recalls experiences during her teenage and early\n                adult years in which she fought racial and gender discrimination, including\n                supporting racial diversity within her sorority. She describes her desire to work in\n                a the religious ministry in New York City and explains her opinion that, racial\n                integration would only occur if white people voluntarily integrated primarily\n                African-American and Latino neighborhoods. She describes her experiences living in\n                East Harlem and and recalls enjoying its liveliness, culture, and honesty of its\n                residents. She discusses a summer volunteer, church work camp for college students\n                that she and her husband managed and recounts the first year of the camp. She\n                describes the Four Disciplines of the East Harlem Protestant Parish Group Ministry\n                which focus on religion, economics, politics, and social action. She explains her\n                opinion on the importance of finding balance between being a mother, a minister's\n                wife, and a community member which depends heavily upon faith and participation in\n                both the church and surrounding community."

The interview covers\n                Eddy's early life in Connecticut, his experiences during World War II, and his\n                experiences in East Harlem as a Protestant minister. Eddy describes New Britain,\n                Connecticut and discusses the relationship between the Yankee residents and the\n                immigrants who settled in New Britain in the early 20th century. He describes his\n                grandparents, their personalities, and their influences on him. He describes his\n                experiences during World War II (WWII) and recounts his duties a volunteer ambulance\n                driver with the American Field Service in northern Africa and the Middle East. He\n                compares the experiences of soldiers during WWII and those who served in the Vietnam\n                War, and the impressions he had of how American civilians perceived the experiences\n                of soldiers and civilians living in countries affected by the war. He explains that\n                after his service in the war, he decided to take time to decide what career he\n                wanted for himself. He recounts his experiences between 1944 and 1948, traveling\n                throughout the United States, working on farms, and learning about different\n                religions. He describes a spiritual experience he had during WWII in Syria, and his\n                interest in Buddhism, Islam, and mystical parts of Judaism. He explains how this\n                experience inspired him to serve the spiritual needs of people and his belief at the\n                time that this would not be possible in established Protestant churches. He recounts\n                taking courses at the Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan in 1945. He discusses\n                his work as a farm laborer in different areas of the United States between 1945 and\n                1948 and studying in New York City during the winters. He recounts enrolling full\n                time at the Seminary, working in East Harlem, and joining the East Harlem Protestant\n                Parish and moving to East Harlem in 1949. He describes the sense of community he\n                witnessed in East Harlem amongst the Puerto Rican, African American, Eastern\n                European, and Italian residents of the neighborhood. He explains that while everyone\n                was aware of the ways in which their neighbors were different from them, they were\n                connected by the fact that they were neighbors and lived together. He discusses the\n                work of the Metro North Citizens' Committee and the Parish to ensure the residents\n                of the neighborhood had adequate housing. He discusses the ways in which public\n                housing projects positively and negatively affected the community and compares them\n                to the tenements they replaced."

This interview was videotaped. The interview covers Billie\n                Biederman's life in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.\n                Biederman discusses her working life and education. She discusses her regret at not\n                having a religious Jewish education as a child. She describes her parents, their\n                immigration experiences, and their working lives. She describes her mother's\n                responsibilities as a janitor of the building in which the family lived on Ludlow\n                Street in the LES and describes the family's apartment on Ludlow Street. She states\n                that she visited the apartment around the time of the interview and relates her\n                astonishment at the fact that her family and their boarders fit into the apartment.\n                She discusses traditions in her family around Jewish holidays and food her mother\n                would prepare for the family. She describes games she would play with her friends\n                and other social and leisure activities in which she participated in the LES. She\n                discusses anti-Semitism in the United States and her experiences of confronting\n                anti-Semitic people in social situations. She discusses her working life after high\n                school, including living in California between 1948 and 1951 and working as a\n                writer. Other topics include customs in the LES around holidays, food in the LES,\n                and Biederman's memoirs."

He recounts his\n                insecurities around speaking English, particularly problems understanding English\n                idioms as a child and the way in which he became comfortable speaking English as an\n                adult He discusses his conversion to the Episcopal Church from Catholic Church and\n                reactions friends and family had to his conversion.

The majority\n                of the interview covers Tamser Cisse's experience as a student in Dakar, Senegal and\n                adjusting to life in New York City. The interview is difficult to understand as the\n                voices are frequently muffled. Cisse recalls his ideas of what the United States\n                (US) would be like based upon American television programs he watched in Dakar\n                including , and his realization\n                that the US was different from the way in which it was portrayed on television. At\n                the time of the interview, Cisse was contemplating his future educational plans and\n                discusses his options with the interviewer which include pursuing higher education\n                at an American university.",

The majority of the interview covers\n                Davenport's childhood experiences growing up during the Great Depression in the LES.\n                She recalls standing in bread and soup lines with her mother and great-grandparents.\n                In the 1930s, Davenport's parents were not able to support the family financially\n                and sent Davenport and her three siblings to a shelter at the Church of Saint\n                Catherine of Genoa in Manhattan. Davenport and her siblings remained at the shelter\n                for about a month until her father regained employment. She attended high school at\n                the Metropolitan Vocational School in Manhattan. Davenport received leave from high\n                school so that she could assist her mother with caring for her sister who had\n                poliomyelitis.

He explains that the majority of the residents\n                were Jewish and the reasons why the residents may not have wanted to accept Latino\n                and African-American residents. He states his opinion that the safety, cleanliness,\n                and infrastructure of the buildings had declined after more Latino and\n                African-American people moved into the buildings in the 1980s and 1990s. He and his\n                wife discuss social events and activities sponsored by settlement houses and the\n                cooperative buildings in the LES, including trips, summer camps, and parties. He\n                discusses the history of the cooperative buildings in the LES and the fact that he\n                learned about it through annual meetings and newsletters. Other topics include his\n                children and a discussion of crime in the LES in the 1940s through the time of the\n                interview."

He recounts his experiences learning\n                English, attending school, and relearning Spanish when he returned to Puerto Rico in\n                his 20s. He discusses his two marriages and his relationship with his daughter. The\n                majority of the interview consists of Ruiz discussing stickball culture in the\n                Bronx, including the fact that each block in the Bronx had its own team, that teams\n                generally reflected the ethnic and racial composition of the neighborhoods, and the\n                organization of games between rival teams and blocks. Ruiz discusses playing for the\n                Sharks and the Young Devils when he was younger and playing for the Minotaurs at the\n                of the interview."

The first 43 minutes of the recording are\n                difficult to hear. This recording consists of four individual interviews with John\n                Stephens, George Murray, Ralph Munoz and Carlos Diaz. The interviews cover each\n                man's experiences playing stickball, with the most detailed interview being the one\n                with Carlos Diaz. Stephens, Murray, and Muno contribute only brief personal\n                introductions. Diaz recalls growing up in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan\n                and discusses the influence of gangs on his childhood. Diaz discusses his opinion on\n                the importance of stickball and of providing children, teenagers, and adults in East\n                Harlem with community activities and organizations to encourage positive life\n                choices and fellowship."

The interviews with Torres and Horse are more detailed and include\n                discussions of their personal lives. Torres recalls the crowds of people who would\n                gather to watch stickball games on Saturdays and Sundays in the East Harlem\n                neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. He discusses the fact that people would watch\n                from their windows and fire escapes, and would often throw money to the players.\n                Horse explains how stickball provided him with a recreational and positive social\n                outlet which helped him resist gang activities."

The majority of the interview covers\n                Kaminsky's involvement in the Workmen's Circle in Manhattan and the Three Arrows\n                Cooperative Society (3A) in Putnam Valley, New York. Kaminsky describes herself as a\n                revolutionary and Trotskyite, and discusses her participation in the Young\n                Communists' League and the Young People's Socialist League. She recalls spending\n                summers at 3A and describes attending social events there. She remembers 3A\n                organizing weekly picnics for the community during the summer where members would\n                cookout, socialize and often get into conversations regarding politics. Kaminsky\n                explains her opinion of Jewish identity that involved being politically and socially\n                responsible rather than overly religious."

Kaminsky was active in various\n                political groups from the time she was 14 years old, including the Young Communists'\n                League and the Young People's Socialist League. In high school she was a member of\n                the American Student Union and an unspecified student led anti-war organization. In\n                the 1930s, she attended Hunter College in Manhattan, where she studied history,\n                economics, and political science, receiving her bachelor's degree. She received her\n                master's degree. She married Peretz Kaminsky when she was 21 years old. They were\n                both active members of an unspecified New York City Yiddish school organization, the\n                Workmen's Circle, and the Jewish Labor Committee. In the summer of 1970, they joined\n                and rented a house at the Three Arrows Cooperative Society in Putnam Valley, New\n                York. At the time of the interview, Kaminsky was president of Three Arrows (3A)."

The majority of the interview covers Manson's childhood in the Harlem and\n                Lower East Side (LES) neighborhoods of Manhattan and his experience at the Three\n                Arrows Cooperative Society (3A) in Putnam Valley, New York. Manson recalls playing\n                in the street in the LES, in particular running underneath horses. He describes the\n                poverty of his family and their neighbors. Manson explains various political and\n                socialist philosophies, and discusses his memberships to the Young People's\n                Socialist League, the War Resisters' League, 3A, and the Hebrew Free Loan Society.\n                He goes into detail about his financial struggles as a young adult and how he\n                borrowed money from the Hebrew Free Loan Society who offered interest-free loans to\n                its members. He discusses in detail the fundamentals of the Hebrew Free Loan Society\n                and the types of loans services they provided for its members. Manson explains that\n                he joined 3A because it required its members to accept cooperative living\n                principles, like common ownership of property, and overall community involvement. He\n                describes giving public speeches to the 3A community as well as to neighborhoods in\n                Manhattan."

                                            "Julius Manson was born Yael Oumansky to a Jewish family in 1907 in the Bronx, New\n                York. His parents immigrated to the United States (US) from Russia in 1905. Manson\n                attended Public School (PS 89) in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan. His parents\n                owned a laundry shop on Orchard Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of\n                Manhattan. He had a summer job at the Equinox Hotel in Vermont when he was 16 years\n                old. During the Great Depression Manson hiked across the US. Upon his return to New\n                York, he joined the Three Arrows Cooperative Society in Putnam Valley, New York.\n                Manson was a member of several political groups including the Young People's\n                Socialist League, the War Resisters' League, and the Hebrew Free Loan Society. He\n                received his bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees from Columbia University in\n                Manhattan and a law degree from Brooklyn College. Manson worked for the\n                International Ladies' Garment Workers Union as a labor mediator for the state of New\n                York, and served as dean of Baruch College in Manhattan."

Wagner Archives at New York University in Manhattan, New\n                York. The majority of the interview covers Bernice Kaufman Nisinson's experiences as\n                a member of the Young Democratic Socialists (YDS) and her interest in political and\n                religious philosophies. She recalls the large selection of student run clubs at\n                James Madison High School in Brooklyn and the fact that she attended a meeting for\n                each club as a way to decide which ones she would like to join. Nisinson argues that\n                it is important to develop your own life philosophy. She spends a majority of her\n                interview discussing general socialist and Jewish beliefs including the importance\n                of education, the emphasis of family togetherness and carrying on traditions."

Her parents\n                immigrated to the United States (US) from Austria-Hungary around 1900. Her father\n                worked as a linguist for a foreign language newspaper in St. Louis, Missouri. When\n                she was 12 years old, Nisinson and her family moved to New York, New York. She\n                attended James Madison High School in Brooklyn and became a member of the student\n                run Hebrew Club and the Young Democratic Socialists. Nisinson married when she was\n                18 years old. In addition to her public school classes, Nisinson would attend\n                lectures at the Rand School of Social Science to learn more about political and\n                religious philosophies."

He recounts his\n              first experiences working as a longshoreman, including the type of work that was\n              available during the Great Depression and extortion of the new workers on the docks.\n              He discusses the formation of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) Local\n              1247. He discusses the work patterns on the docks, the formation of work gangs, and\n              pay rates for different types of cargo. He recounts becoming a foreman and the\n              difference in work for longshoreman and foremen. He lists the different ports in which\n              he worked: Hoboken, Jersey City, and Edgewater in New Jersey, and Staten Island and\n              Brooklyn in New York. He explains the ways in which information was disseminated about\n              which ports had work. Other topics include strikes and organized crime involvement in\n              the ILA and on the docks."
