Accent begins by recounting his career as a boxer and how he\n              enjoyed it. He notes that while his first wife was very supportive of his career,\n              often sitting in the front row during many of his matches, his second wife held little\n              love for the sport and his involvement with it. He describes the infidelity of his\n              first wife; the tempestuous nature of their relationship; his discovery of her affair\n              with a local police officer; and the violent dissolution of their marriage. Accent\n              describes his career as both a trimmer and a fireman aboard ships that sailed to a\n              variety of locations including England, Italy, Greece, Canada, the Netherlands,\n              Argentina, and Santo Domingo. He recounts switching from trimmer to fireman because\n              the latter was a less labor intensive job. Despite admitting that he was not the most\n              diligent Seventh-Day Adventist, he spends a good portion of the interview explaining\n              the philosophy of his religion including his view of God as merciful and wonderful;\n              the concept of doing the right thing to each and every human being; the need to lend a\n              helping hand wherever it was needed; and the importance of upholding the Sabbath."

Altman describes her childhood in Poland,\n              recounting a pogrom that took place in the area where her family lived and the fact\n              that her mother would lock her in the house to protect her from anti-Semitic violence.\n              She discusses the differences in religious observance between Jews in Poland and in\n              the US. She recalls working in different factories, including the Albert Waist\n              Company, and describes how the ILGWU would often send workers into non-union shops in\n              order to unionize them. She recalls strikes in which she participated, including one\n              at which she was arrested for pinching a strikebreaker. Altman describes her happiness\n              in being able to bring her mother and younger siblings over to the US. She discusses\n              her mother's reactions to life in New York City and her pleasure in having running\n              water in their apartment. Summary is available for this interview."

Artler briefly discusses her childhood in Poland, noting her\n              father's occupation as a butcher, before moving on to describe her memories of her\n              initial years in New York City living in the back of her father's butcher shop. As\n              business declined in their initial location, Artler recalls the way in which her\n              family moved throughout the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.\n              Artler specifically notes that they moved to better themselves, whether through better\n              rent or living arrangements. She briefly describes her three years of school, placing\n              more emphasis on the various jobs she held in garment factories making feather hat\n              ornaments, children's dresses, and the fronts of ladies' dresses. She describes the\n              conditions of the factories in which she worked as being acceptable, neither\n              exceptionally dirty or crowded. She mentions the worker demographic as being split\n              between Italians and Jews and that the two groups got along well within the workspace.\n              She notes the delineation of work between men, women, and children and the tension\n              between the manager and the employees due to his extravagant lifestyle. Artler notes\n              that while she originally gave all of her wages to her parents in an effort to augment\n              the household's income, she eventually contested this agreement and kept more of the\n              money she earned. She discusses her membership in an unspecified union (likely the\n              International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and her participation in strikes for\n              higher wages, shorter work weeks, and greater job security, all of which the union\n              eventually succeeded in acquiring. She recounts participating in union sponsored\n              social events in order to stay informed about her community and going to movies and\n              shows with the circle of friends that she made through the union. Summary is available\n              for this interview."

After immigrating, the family\n              initially stayed with Artler's uncle before moving to Brooklyn, New York, where her\n              father opened a butcher shop. Artler attended school until she was fourteen, moving\n              into the labor force as soon as she was able. She worked predominantly in the garment\n              district, making both children's and ladies' dresses, until shortly after her\n              marriage. Work was seasonally based, so Artler spent part of the year unemployed,\n              varying from a month to half of the year. While working in the factories, she became a\n              member of an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers'\n              Union) and participated in both social and union activities."

The\n              interview covers Auerbach's childhood in Romania, her early experiences in the United\n              States (US), her work in garment factories, and her home life. Auerbach discusses\n              living with an aunt in Romania after her mother immigrated to the US; her aunt\n              mistreating her; listening to her cousins' lessons with a local rabbi; teaching\n              herself to read Hebrew; and attempting to live with another aunt. She describes living\n              with her mother and five siblings in a three room apartment on Allen Street in the\n              Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. She discusses her first jobs in factories\n              in the Lower East Side, including learning to use different sewing machines; making\n              children's dresses and house dresses; encountering labor unions during a work\n              stoppage; and working her way up in pay as she gained more experience. She recalls\n              attending Broadway shows and spending the summers in Monticello, New York. She\n              discusses her marriage, including the first time she met her husband; their courtship\n              and early marriage; and their children. Transcript and summary are available for this\n              interview."

The date and location are unknown.\n              This interview covers Morris Bagno's childhood in Poland; his immigration to various\n              European countries before, during, and after World War I; his immigration to Canada\n              and the United States (US); and his life and work in the garment industry in New York\n              and California. Bagno begins by describing his childhood in Poland, noting that the\n              industry in his town was much smaller than in the cities that he would encounter in\n              the US. He explains that he received the equivalent of a college education at his\n              local yeshiva while working with his father in the timber industry. He describes his\n              decision to leave Poland in 1912 in order to avoid conscription into the army and to\n              escape his father's orthodox Judaism. He recalls his immigration to various countries\n              in which he lived including England, Belgium, Denmark, and Canada before his\n              immigration to the US in 1920. He recounts the awe he felt at seeing skyscrapers upon\n              his arrival in New York City, which formed a stark contrast to the rural town where he\n              grew up. He recounts working with his uncle for a short time before deciding to find a\n              job on his own and his his uncle's belief that he was indebted to and dependent upon\n              him. He recalls joining the local chapter of the International Ladies' Garment\n              Workers' Union, which he remarked was special for its inclusion of women as members\n              and the fact that women could hold high positions within the union leadership. He\n              discusses his progression from a tailor to union delegate to supervisor and liaison\n              between workers and employers. He mentions that he made sure to keep his home life and\n              his work life separate as he did not want his wife becoming involved in union affairs\n              or interfering in his affairs. He notes that the passage of the Norris-La Guardia Act\n              in 1932 and the National Labor Relations Act in 1935 mitigated the effects of the\n              Great Depression by preventing lockouts and allowing for unionization. He recalls\n              temporarily relocating to Los Angeles, California in 1949 at the behest of the\n              president of the union in order to deal with the rising tension in one of the locals\n              between the Social Democrats faction, of which he was a member, and the Communist\n              faction, who were viewed as dangerous to the union."

                                        "Text": "This interview was conducted by Francis Facciolo on February 26 and March 12, 1975.\n              The location is unknown. This interview covers Abraham Belson's childhood in Russia;\n              his immigration to the United States (US); and his life and work in the garment\n              industry in Massachusetts and New York. Belson begins by describing part of his\n              father's history, recounting a time when the Russian government forced the Jewish\n              population to convert to a religion other than Judaism and his father's refusal and\n              subsequent draft into the army for fifteen years. Belson recounts his membership in an\n              unspecified Jewish club (likely the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland\n              and Russia) aligned against the czar and the feeling that he had to work against an\n              authority that was not concerned with his well-being. He describes immigrating to the\n              US; living briefly in Massachusetts; and moving to New York City where his family and\n              many friends from his hometown lived. He spends the rest of the interview focused on\n              the happenings of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), which he\n              joined in 1907. He mentions an unsuccessful strike in 1907 that lasted 13 weeks,\n              resulting in landlords evicting families from their homes when they were unable to pay\n              rent and the fact that they had to beg in the streets until the union was forced to\n              compromise. He explains that the union reorganized between 1907 and 1910 and rallied\n              for its first large general strike in 1910. Belson describes the camaraderie that he\n              felt with his fellow union members; the union events they attended together; and the\n              picnics and other outings they had during their free time. He notes that this was\n              common in several tight-knit communities in Brooklyn, Bronxville, and other parts of\n              New York that were populated predominantly by ILGWU members. He recalls becoming a\n              union officer in 1949, emphasizing that this position required that he earn the\n              respect of both workers and management in order to be elected and reelected every\n              year. Belson describes how the conditions of the workplace for garment workers\n              improved due to union influence, noting better wages, better job hours, more job\n              security, and the fact that workers were no longer required to rent their own machines\n              in order to work. He shares an anecdote about a strike in Newark, New Jersey that\n              resulted in a prolonged stalemate between management and the union and how he and\n              other union members strongarmed the management to cooperate with the union\n              liaison."

The audio recording for this\n              interview is missing. This interview covers Stella Bialon's life in Poland; her\n              immigration to the United States (US); and her husband's involvement in both an\n              unspecified hatters' union and an unspecified millinery trade union. Bialon describes\n              her childhood in Europe, noting that her family's wealth enabled her to attend school.\n              She discusses her parents' opposition to her marriage because of the economic\n              disparity between herself and her husband. She recounts that her brother owned a\n              garment business in Manhattan, New York. She explains that she came to the US in 1910\n              originally on a three month trip but stayed there permanently, later sending for her\n              husband. She describes her husband's dedication to Socialism; his position as\n              secretary and later chairman of an unspecified millinery trade union; the dishonest\n              business practices utilized by employers to monopolize both the garment industry and\n              its workers; and the contrast in freedom of speech between Poland and the US.

This\n              interview covers Ethel Bolton's childhood in England; her immigration to the United\n              States (US) in 1901; and her life and work in New Jersey and New York. Topics\n              regarding Bolton's childhood in England include her mother's death when Bolton was\n              five years old; the subsequent immigration of her father and older siblings to the US\n              while she remained in England with her grandfather; and her father's second marriage\n              in the US. Bolton describes her father's work as a printer, noting that he held\n              various jobs at newspaper companies from the  in London, England to the  and the  in New York.\n              She explains that he was an active member of Typographical #6 of the International\n              Typographical Union and was involved in various strikes which resulted in food\n              rationing for his family. Bolton describes her dislike for her stepmother, recalling\n              that she often faked illness so that Bolton was required to stay home from school to\n              care for her and attributes the various relocations between New York and New Jersey to\n              her stepmother's antagonism towards neighbors and local ministers.

She recounts adopting his teenage children as her own. She discusses the\n              fact that her husband tended to treat her as if she were a child due to the age gap\n              between them and that she made a point of following his rules except in voting. She\n              briefly recounts working as a caretaker for young children before working as a\n              switchboard operator at two advertising agencies, the Geland Sumner Company and the\n              Kudner Agency. At Kudner, she describes her work in the checking department, reviewing\n              advertisements from Nebraska to Texas. She notes that the companies she worked for\n              treated her extremely well, giving her bonuses at the end of the month, hosting\n              holiday parties, and paying for a \"crying towel\" party when all of the employees over\n              sixty-five were forced to retire. She describes some of the jobs her husband held,\n              which included a position at the Dictaphone Company; executive secretary at an\n              unspecified advertising club; and a managerial position at the Empire State Building,\n              granted to him by Alfred Smith when Bolton was unemployed during the Great Depression.\n              Other topics include her sister's missionary work in Africa; parts of her husband's\n              history; her faith and involvement with the Church of Truth at Carnegie Hall in the\n              Midtown neighborhood of Manhattan."

Topics include Katy Bottman's family in Romania; her experiences in\n              Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; her work in Cleveland, Ohio; her work in New York, New York;\n              her education; and her views on labor unions. She recalls her family in Romania,\n              including her father's work as a businessman; the fact that her mother did not work\n              outside of the home; and her family's wealth. She discusses her early life in the\n              United States (US), including living with her cousin in Pittsburgh and working in his\n              custom tailoring shop; having to hide from inspectors because she was an underage\n              worker; and being perceived as supportive of union members during strikes, while she\n              worked at home for her cousin. Bottman recalls her experiences in Cleveland, including\n              meeting and marrying her husband; keeping house rather than working; and being\n              referred to as a baby by the other wives in the community because of her age. She\n              recounts her husband opening his own dress factory, where he made over 200 dollars a\n              week and employed more than 30 people."

She recalls that while men were often\n              educated, women were not; that younger workers learned from the older workers who had\n              been educated in Europe; and that one's position within the factory was partially\n              determined by their education. She recalls feeling proud that she taught herself to\n              read and write English and feeling disappointed that she did not retain much of her\n              Romanian language skills."

She discusses unions to\n              which she belonged in Cleveland and New York, but does not specify to which union or\n              local she belonged.

This\n              interview covers Mary Brackett's childhood in Ireland; her immigration to the United\n              States (US); and her life and work as a baby nurse in New York City. Brackett\n              discusses her early years in Ireland, briefly mentioning her education at Presentation\n              Convent School. Other topics from her childhood include the role of the local priest\n              as an educational, moral, and political leader in the community; the strict morality\n              that he conveyed to his congregation; and his tendency to take the side of the Irish\n              when arbitrating disputes between English authorities and the local Irish population.\n              Brackett mentions the relationship between the Quakers and the Catholics in Ireland,\n              noting that many of the Quaker children attended Catholic schools though they did not\n              participate in their more religious aspects. She discusses the history of her\n              grandfather's life, including his eviction from his farm during the Great Famine\n              (1845-1852) and his time as a woodland ranger. "

Brackett notes that she and many of the other staff members\n              who cared for the children were treated like family by their employers, often eating\n              and traveling with them. She emphasizes how she kept in touch with the family even\n              when they moved to Larchmont, New York and how she attended one daughter's wedding.\n              She explains that she moved on to care for the children of comedian Fanny Brice, who\n              also treated her as an equal.

Both Brawer and Huhnenberg use Yiddish terms\n              throughout the interview with little explanation of their meaning. Topics include\n              Brawer's childhood and family; his work experience; his views on unions, politics,\n              religion, and race; and his romantic relationships. Brawer discusses his childhood in\n              Polish Galicia, including his father's work in real estate and the fact that he was\n              emotionally absent from his family; the Yiddish songs his mother would sing to him;\n              his siblings, all of whom died in World War I and World War II; and his introduction\n              to the Zionist movement. He discusses the anti-Semitism of the working class in\n              Galicia; the segregation of Jews in the community; and his lack of education there. He\n              describes his attempts to avoid the conscription into the Polish Army, including\n              feigning a limp and bribing doctors to say he was injured; and immigrating to Germany\n              in 1911 and to the United States (US) in 1912. He recalls his time in Germany,\n              including working in a kosher grocery store; having trouble finding work because he\n              couldn't speak German; and wasting a majority of his money on entertainment. Brawer\n              recalls his life shortly after his immigration to the US, including the Hebrew\n              Immigrant Aid Society assisting with his entrance into the country; and his trouble\n              finding work because he had no skills. He discusses working for Jewish managers in\n              non-union restaurants; owning failed embroidery factories; and working as a salesman\n              in the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.

He recalls his enrollment in the Democratic Party\n              despite his dislike of liberals, progressives, and Socialists, and the fact that he\n              was not interested in politics. He discusses his opinions on labor unions, in\n              particular that they take advantage of consumers and employers; force workers to join\n              if they want a job; and allow workers to be disrespectful to both employers and\n              consumers.st."

She notes that the\n              plantation, granted to the family by the federal government due to her grandmother's\n              Cherokee heritage, spread for miles and isolated them from the surrounding\n              communities. She explains that in order to keep the plantation self-sufficient, many\n              of her family members assumed various roles within the community, with one of her\n              cousins working as the schoolteacher and her great uncle and father working as\n              preachers in the local church. She discusses her grandmother's role as the matriarch\n              of the family. She recounts her move to Charleston, South Carolina, mentioning that\n              she had never interacted with a white person before arriving in the city. She focuses\n              on the stifled interactions between the racial groups in the city, describing the\n              influence of the Jim Crow laws; and the intense scrutiny that black residents faced\n              from white police officers. She describes the differences between the schools in St.\n              George and in Charleston. "

                                        "Text": "Brown describes her move to New York City, where she was reunited with her husband.\n              She discusses her initial impressions of New York City, conveying the security she\n              felt in living there through anecdotes about sleeping on the roof and fire escapes,\n              and keeping her door open at night. Brown recalls how her husband found work through a\n              Civilian Conservation Corps camp, which resulted in his Army service during World War\n              II. She explains that she was wary of her husband when he came back from the Army,\n              having heard stories of other veterans' changed demeanor and behavior. Brown\n              emphasizes the changes in Harlem as a strong black community developed in the wake of\n              white flight. She spends a considerable amount of time noting the differences among\n              the churches in St. George, Charleston, and Harlem, noting that St. George's preachers\n              focused more on serving the community and the preachers in Charleston and Harlem\n              focused on more secular matters. Brown later describes her husband's brief, but\n              serious illness, which resulted in multiple hospital visits before he died at home by\n              her side."

Antonio Buono and an\n              unidentified friend frequently converse in Italian during the interview. This\n              interview covers Buono's childhood in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US)\n              in 1934; and his life and work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn, New York. Buono begins\n              by describing his childhood on a small farm in Italy, recalling his father's\n              immigration to the US in 1902 and his sporadic visits to Italy. He recounts his and\n              his twin brother's decision to immigrate to the US and join their father in Brooklyn,\n              where Buono worked in a small provisions factory. He recounts his decision to work as\n              a longshoreman because of the flexibility of the work hours and the increase in pay.\n              He recalls that though the job was labor intensive, the fresh air, consistent hours,\n              and waterfront view made the job much more bearable than factory work. He describes\n              how joining an unspecified union (likely the International Longshoremen's Association)\n              in 1940 helped to maintain his wages and hours and explains that there were few\n              strikes during World War II in order to maintain the war effort. Buono describes the\n              relationship among the Italians in Brooklyn, many of whom were longshoremen, and notes\n              that although the immigrants from different parts of Italy could be clannish when they\n              socialized, they would present a united front in the workplace. Other topics include\n              his leisure activities and Italian traditions that were kept alive in the United\n              States."

Burke briefly discusses his\n              childhood in Ireland, explaining how his family farm was passed down to his father;\n              his brief education; and the emigration of his family from Ireland. Other memories\n              include the influence of the clergy in local government; the destruction of a nearby\n              town by the Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force; and and the way in which this\n              contributed to his decision to immigrate. His early recollections of the US include\n              his spur of the moment decision to leave Boston, Massachusetts; finding work in New\n              York City hours after arriving; traveling around the US (including Nebraska and\n              Illinois); and his employment with the New York City Board of Transportation. Within\n              his discussion of his time with the Board of Transportation, there is a detailed\n              discussion about the hierarchy of workers and their mobility within the department;\n              the racial integration of the workforce; the guarantee of 48 hours a week once hired;\n              and his position manning a change booth at the 168th Street subway station.

Topics\n              include Burton's life in Jamaica, his immigration to the United States (US), his work\n              as a carpenter, and his union involvement. Burton begins by discussing his early life\n              in Jamaica, including his parents dying when he was very young; his grandparents\n              believing his father was an unfit parent; and Burton's father raising his brothers\n              while Burton was raised by his grandparents. He recalls the educational system in\n              Jamaica; and his attendance at school until he was 14 years old. He discusses his work\n              as a carpenter's apprentice; sharecropping and land distribution on his grandfather's\n              farm; and social activities such as cricket and rounders. His first impressions of the\n              US include his feeling of surprise when he first saw snow; his opinion that people\n              worried less in Jamaica than they did in the US; and the fact that he had no intention\n              of living in the US permanently. While discussing his career, Burton mentions working\n              in foundries before joining the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of\n              America Local 18 in 1926; and working for the Works Progress Administration during the\n              Great Depression. He also discusses racial tensions between carpenters, particularly\n              their disputes when black workers earned equal pay."

Susan U. Callens\n              speaks very softly throughout the interview. The interview covers Callens's childhood\n              and adolescence in South Carolina; her migration to New York, New York after World War\n              II (WWII); and her work as a domestic worker and nurse's aide. Callens recounts some\n              of her family history, noting her paternal grandfather's ownership of 950 acres of\n              land; his dedication to his children's education; and the struggle over his estate\n              after his death. She recalls her childhood on the family plantation before moving\n              around South Carolina in accordance with her father's sharecropping. Despite\n              recounting several instances of segregation, she states that she never felt directly\n              affected by racial discrimination. She describes her work for a family in South\n              Carolina, noting that she split her time between domestic work and farm work depending\n              on the season. She explains that she moved to North Carolina to pursue work and met\n              and married her husband while there. "

She describes the changes in her husband's behavior after WWII, noting\n              that he was withdrawn for a number of years before he returned to his normal behavior.\n              Callens notes that she was employed as a domestic worker for a number of years before\n              pursuing a career as a nurse's aide at the behest of a doctor for whom she had worked.\n              She emphasizes her and her children's conversion to Catholicism, noting that both she\n              and her father believed in teaching their children the tenets of their faith while\n              letting them make their own decision about whether to join a church. Other topics from\n              her time in New York include anecdotes about her children; her husband's relationship\n              with his family and his Army friends; her husband's occupations; the various\n              neighborhoods she lived in; and her father's deteriorating health."

The interview covers Lily Campanile's parents' background and\n              immigration to the United States (US), her childhood in Illinois, her husband's\n              working life, their marriage and family, her personal life, and members of her\n              extended family. Campanile discusses her father's life in Italy, his immigration to\n              the US, and his work as a coal miner in Illinois. She discusses her mother's childhood\n              in Sicily, her work picking fruit as a child, and her immigration to the US. She\n              describes the ethnic composition of Louisville, Illinois, including the fact that hers\n              was one of two Italian families and that most of the people in the town were Russian.\n              She also describes the ethnic composition of Benld, Illinois, which was mainly Polish\n              and Russian, with her family being part of very small Italian minority. She recounts\n              how she met her husband; their engagement; and their decision to move from Chicago to\n              New York. She discusses his work scraping and painting ships in a Navy yard in New\n              Jersey and his decision to become a longshoreman in order to work closer to home. She\n              discusses which piers he worked on in Brooklyn; the type of cargo he would help load;\n              the unreliable nature of the work; and injuries he sustained at work. She discusses\n              her unhappiness at not having worked outside of the home, due to having to care for\n              her mother as a young woman and then caring for her own children, and the isolation\n              she felt as a result. Other topics include not having time or money for leisure\n              activities and her disappointment in missing out on these things as a young woman;\n              double standards set by her parents for her and her brothers; her daughters' marriages\n              and families; and her living situation at the time of the interview. An index is\n              available for this interview."

Canossa discusses his\n              immigration to the US in 1923, including not returning to his ship when it made port;\n              immigrating alone because his immigration was not planned in advance; and feeling glad\n              that he immigrated to the US. He discusses the ILA, including the fact that there was\n              always a union on the waterfront; that there were no requirements for joining other\n              than paying dues; and that union benefits did not begin until after World War II.

Bruno Canossa was assisted by Mario Cinisomo, who helps Canossa explain his\n              thoughts. Topics include Canossa's childhood, his immigration to the United States\n              (US), his working experience, and his labor union involvement. Canossa recollects his\n              early life in Italy, including his father working in the engine room on ships in a\n              Navy yard and that his family had a comfortable living. His early memories of New\n              York, New York include jumping ship when the boat he worked on arrived in port;\n              getting his first job through friends he met in New York City; having multiple\n              roommates in order to save money; and learning English in night school. Despite the\n              fact that he immigrated on a whim, he did not consider immigrating to New York City a\n              mistake. He discusses socializing predominantly with members of the International\n              Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and the Catholic Church; and frequenting cafes to\n              spend time with other Italian immigrants. He also discusses the differences between\n              New York City in the 1920s and at the time of the interview, including money going\n              farther and people acting respectfully. He explains that he joined the ILA because he\n              could not work without being in the union, and that union benefits did not start until\n              after World War II. He discusses working on long term projects out of state; and that\n              longshoremen did not want their children to become longshoremen unless they were not\n              good students."

Cappeletti discusses her childhood, including her parents'\n              immigration to the US; her life in Italy with her grandfather; and her immigration to\n              the US after his death. She describes being introduced to her husband and having to\n              meet him secretly because of the strict rules her father set for her behavior. She\n              describes the buildings and people in the West Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New\n              York, including the fact that few Italians lived there. She discusses her work in a\n              dress factory; modeling dress samples while the manager altered them; and sewing\n              buttons by hand and other pieces on sewing machines. She also discusses her salary and\n              the fact that the factory was not unionized. She describes her living situation after\n              her marriage: she and her husband lived with his four brothers and their wives, and\n              the group bought two apartment houses. She discusses financial difficulties they had\n              and the fact that all of the women had to work in order for the group to afford the\n              mortgage payments on the buildings. She discusses her social life before and during\n              her marriage, including taking boat trips along the Hudson River and dancing at the\n              Roseland Ballroom."

Her mother died in 1909 in a fire in the dress factory in which\n              she worked. Her father married an Irish woman, with whom he had two daughters. The\n              family lived on West 10th Street and the butcher shop was on Bleecker Street.\n              Cappeletti attended school on Hudson Street. She worked as a dressmaker in a factory\n              on 34th Street in Manhattan. She married in 1928."

The first name of the narrator is unknown. Mr.\n              Caravello is sometimes hard to understand due to his Italian accent. The interview\n              covers his working life in Italy and the United States (US). Caravello discusses\n              working with his father and older brother in a vineyard in Italy and grafting vines\n              from France onto native vines. He explains that a disease killed off the majority of\n              the vines before his immigration to the US, but does not say whether this led to his\n              decision to immigrate. He explains that his father was the foreman of the vineyard;\n              that a director and inspector would come from Rome every two weeks to oversee their\n              work; and that they arranged for Caravello to attend high school. He recounts his\n              achievements in school proudly. He discusses the fact that he immigrated to the US in\n              order to work in vineyards in California but that his family and a good job in a\n              nickel-plating factory kept him in New York City. He recounts moving with his wife and\n              baby to Madison, Wisconsin after five or six years in New York and working as a\n              machinist."

The date of the interview is unknown. A second interview was conducted by\n              Leon Fink at the International Longshoremen's Association Union Hall on Court Street\n              in Brooklyn, New York on April 4, 1973. The main topics of these interviews include\n              the lives of Cinisomo's parents; his employment prior to his involvement with the\n              International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) Local 1814; social issues within the\n              ILA; and social activities in which he participated outside of the ILA. Cinisomo\n              discusses his father, including his positions as sergeant major in the Italian Navy\n              and as a sailor on a Swedish merchant marine ship, and difficulties he had while\n              working in the US due to his height, health issues, and illiteracy. He discusses his\n              mother being a housewife; her work assisting other Italian immigrants in the United\n              States (US) with their paperwork; and his parents' arranged marriage in Italy.\n              Cinisomo discusses his educational experiences, including graduating from public\n              school; attending high school at night; and taking some college classes sponsored by\n              the Works Progress Administration (WPA). He describes his employment before the ILA,\n              including working in a laundry, a paper box factory, and as a grocery clerk, and his\n              employment as an organizer in the WPA from the early 1930s until the start of World\n              War II. He recalls social issues within the ILA, including the fact that the Irish and\n              Germans controlled the union; that Italian workers were confined to working in the\n              holds of the ships; and that striking was difficult because the Irish controlled the\n              ILA and the police department. Cinisomo discusses leisure activities in which he\n              participated, including attending church every Sunday; playing cards on his days off;\n              and not playing sports because he was exhausted after his shifts. Index is available\n              for the April 4th interview."

This interview\n              covers Elizabeth Clanton's childhood in Alabama; her migration throughout the United\n              States (US); her work as a nurses' aide; and her union activity. She begins by\n              describing her childhood in Atmore, Alabama. She focuses on how Atmore was divided\n              along racial lines, describing segregation in neighborhoods, schools, churches, and\n              the movies; and the limited, strained social contact between members of the white and\n              black communities. She also describes learning how to read in school, which enabled\n              her to read the newspaper for her parents, neither of whom were literate. Other topics\n              from her childhood include her close relationship with her father; some of her\n              grandparents' history; leisure activities; holiday traditions; the type of music to\n              which she listened; and her religious traditions and values.

She describes meeting and marrying her first husband in\n              Alabama despite her family's reservations about her being too young and her occupation\n              as a domestic worker for various families in Atmore, a position that she acquired from\n              her mother when the latter became ill. She spends a great deal of time discussing her\n              movement throughout the US, including moving to Cleveland, Ohio in order to find\n              domestic work to support her children, whom she had left with her parents after she\n              separated from her husband; receiving a certificate in practical nursing in Chicago,\n              Illinois; and moving to Brooklyn, New York to live with one of her sons. She recalls\n              sending much of the money she earned back to her family and writing letters to her\n              mother and children to accompany each paycheck. Clanton discusses her union\n              involvement, including being introduced to the idea of unions by organizer Jesse Olson\n              while working at Beth Israel Hospital, as a nurses' aide, in Manhattan; going to\n              various hotels in New York City for union meetings; discussing union activities with\n              co-workers only on breaks or after work; and participating in a hospital workers'\n              strike in 1959. Clanton discusses her opinion that despite the union not supporting\n              striking workers sufficiently she realized the benefits of belonging to a union; her\n              appreciation of Local 1199 after her retirement; and the educational programs and\n              social activities that Local 1199 provided."

It covers Arthur Cohen's\n              childhood, his work as an electrician, and his career as a semi-professional baseball\n              player. Cohen discusses growing up in a predominantly Irish section of the Lower East\n              Side neighborhood of Manhattan, in which his family was one of two Jewish families,\n              and how his mother would be protected on her way home from local poker games by\n              neighborhood ruffians. He describes his work at the Herring-Hall-Marvin Safe Company,\n              attaching safe doors and setting the combinations. He describes his work as an\n              electrician for industrial companies and being forced to leave this work due to his\n              wife's illness. He recounts his years playing baseball as a catcher and traveling with\n              two teams, the Colonials and the Chambers Arrows."

The interview covers Rose Cohen's early life and education in Russia, her\n              immigration to the United States (US), her political activity, her working life, and\n              her union activity. Cohen discusses her childhood in Russia, in particular, convincing\n              her father to allow her to attend public school. She discusses immigrating to the US\n              and living with her sisters on Orchard Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of\n              Manhattan, New York. She discusses her first job in a shirtwaist factory; her attempts\n              at unionizing the shop; and her attempts at recruiting workers into the Socialist\n              Party of America. Other topics include brief histories of the Russian Revolution and\n              the Workmen's Circle and the importance of socialism in Cohen's life."

Philip Randolph Houses in the\n              Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York on April 25, 1974. The audio recording for\n              this interview is missing. This interview covers Cora Coker's childhood in Louisiana\n              and Illinois; her migration to New York, New York; her jobs in domestic service and in\n              factories; and her family. Coker recounts her childhood in Hammond, Louisiana, noting\n              that strawberry picking season interfered with her education. She recalls Klu Klux\n              Klan activity in her city; that white people owned many of the farms and businesses in\n              the area; and the lynching of a woman named Emma Hooker. She explains that her family\n              generally had friendly relationships with white people, recalling that they lived on\n              property owned by white people before her father built her family a house; that many\n              people in her family were named after the family that owned the property on which they\n              lived; and that that family sent them a wagon full of toys at Christmas. She explains\n              that her family moved from Hammond to Chicago, Illinois after her father lost his job\n              for walking through a segregated railroad station and then fighting with the man who\n              chastised him for it. She compares Hammond and Chicago, noting that her neighborhood\n              in Chicago was split between black residents and Polish residents but that there was\n              no animosity between the groups. She explains that she quit school because she saw no\n              future in it."

She describes her\n              husband's occupation as a boxer and notes that, although he excelled in his sport,\n              there were few chances for him to fight in big matches because of discrimination\n              against black contenders. She explains that she found various domestic worker\n              positions through an employment agency and that she worked less frequently after\n              having children. She recalls a contrast between being content and in love and\n              struggling to make ends meet during the Great Depression. She describes the\n              differences between her relationship with her mother and her children's relationship\n              with her, focusing on her efforts to communicate with them, including having monthly\n              family meetings. Other topics include her leisure activities and traditions; her\n              father's occupation and income; her husband's death in 1943; her children's education\n              and occupations; and a comparison between life in the northern United States (US) and\n              the southern US."

Topics of\n              discussion include Annie Cole's childhood, education, work experience, and union\n              involvement. Cole briefly discusses her early life in Alabama and Texas; her education\n              at the Tuskegee Institute; and the hardships she endured in attending college,\n              including working long hours during the day and being too tired to study at night. She\n              spends a majority of the interview discussing her working life, including a 6 month\n              internship at an unspecified hospital on 125th street in the Harlem neighborhood of\n              Manhattan, New York and her job as a dietary aide at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx,\n              New York, which she began in 1952. She discusses in detail her reasons for joining\n              Local 1199, including speaking with a strike organizer about her frustrations\n              regarding taking on the work of the striking workers, in addition to her own. Cole\n              discusses issues that she faced once she was a member of the union, including not\n              receiving the same pay as hospital employees with different job titles, even though\n              they did the same work, and unfair scheduling and benefits. She also discusses her\n              struggles against management regarding workplace and pay discrimination throughout her\n              career."

This interview contains a\n              roundtable discussion with at least eight individuals, who reflect on their\n              immigration or migration to the United States (US) and New York, New York. The\n              narrators tend to speak over one another, making it difficult to distinguish who is\n              speaking, and some narrators contribute more to the conversation than others. Topics\n              covered in this interview include reasons for immigration/migration; family situations\n              before and after immigration or migration; conditions during immigration, including\n              memories of Ellis Island; native New Yorkers' views of and relationships with the\n              increasing immigrant population; race relations within the US and other countries; the\n              comparison between union and non-union jobs and conditions; and the comparison between\n              New York City neighborhoods in the past and at the time of the interview. The\n              interview ends with the moderator addressing the logistics of individual interviews\n              for those who were interested."

Topics include Maud Cowen's childhood,\n              her immigration to the United States (US), her first impressions of the US, her\n              employment, and her family. Cowen recounts her early life in Jamaica including her\n              large family; her father owning a farm and her recollection of shipping oranges in\n              barrels and raising animals; and teaching herself how to make dresses. She recounts\n              immigration officials in the US not wanting Cowen to leave with her black cousin when\n              she arrived in New York, New York. Cowen discusses her negative first impressions of\n              the US, including feeling out of place and crying every night; feeling that people\n              were unfriendly; and that she never had enough money. She recalls the US attempting to\n              deport her to Jamaica or Great Britain during World War I and fighting the\n              deportation. Cowan discusses her employment, including working at an ammunition\n              factory in New Jersey; working in a laundry pressing soldiers' uniforms; sewing\n              dresses as part of a display in a shop window in the Garment District neighborhood of\n              Manhattan; working as a kosher cook; and being a maid and companion in a hospital.\n              Cowen discusses her kosher cooking, including learning the skill from a friendly\n              Jewish woman for whom she worked; cooking for individuals as well as catering parties;\n              and leaving this line of work after being severely burned lighting an oven. She\n              discusses her daughters in detail, including the fact that they were both well\n              educated and married, that both wanted her to move back to Jamaica at the time of the\n              interview; and that one daughter owns 40 acres of land with a large house and a\n              maid."

The interview covers\n              Carolina Crupi's childhood in Italy, her immigration to the United States (US), her\n              marriage and children, her working life, and her life at the time of the interview.\n              Crupi discusses her childhood in Italy; her education; her father's pattern of working\n              for a time in the US and returning to Italy; and her aspiration to become a teacher.\n              She discusses her immigration to the US, in particular securing a chaperone to\n              accompany her on the voyage. She describes her life with her father in Utica, New\n              York; the different ethnic groups in the city; and the factory in which she worked.\n              She discusses moving to New York City and living with her aunt's family in the East\n              Village neighborhood of Manhattan. She recounts the different factories in which she\n              worked before her marriage and her departure from the workforce to manage the\n              household and care for her children. She discusses her husband, including his laundry\n              business and produce store, his jealous nature, and the fact that he would not allow\n              her to leave the house. She discusses their move to Brooklyn and that most of the\n              people in their neighborhood were Jewish. She describes her life at the time of the\n              interview, including enjoying her independence. She discusses her children; their\n              education; and their spouses and children. She discusses her Catholicism, including\n              not attending church because she had too much work to do at home; ensuring that her\n              children attended church; and being disappointed in one of her children for marrying a\n              person who was not Catholic."

She discusses the migrations of her siblings,\n              two of whom left Colleton County for New York and describes her own decision to\n              migrate to New York with an aunt. She discusses her employment as a domestic worker\n              for ten years and the ways in which she found jobs every year or two. She discusses\n              changing to factory work because it was less physically demanding and had regular\n              hours; working for the Ideal Toy Company for about eight years; and returning to\n              domestic work. She recounts taking a job as a dietary aide at Mount Sinai Hospital in\n              Manhattan in 1953 and describes her responsibilities preparing food and food trays for\n              patients. She discusses the organization of the hospital workers at Mount Sinai into\n              Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union in 1958 and 1959; an eight\n              week strike at the end of 1958 and the beginning of 1959; an election between Local\n              1199 and an unspecified union; and her decision to vote for Local 1199 despite not\n              knowing what they would be able to do for the workers. She discusses her desire for\n              respect from other people and, in particular, her employers and coworkers and gives\n              examples of conflicts she had with people who did not treat her with respect."

Leonard Currieri's\n              wife, Rose, occasionally contributes to the interview. This interview covers\n              Currieri's childhood in Sciacca, Italy; his immigration to New York in 1920; and his\n              life and work in the garment industry in Brooklyn, New York up to the time of the\n              interview. Currieri begins by describing his childhood and education in Italy. He\n              notes his family's long history in maritime trade; his father's medal of honor in\n              recognition of his 24 years of navigation service; and his own desire to become a\n              marine officer. He explains that he and his mother immigrated to the US in 1920, where\n              they settled on North Portland Avenue in Brooklyn, New York. Currieri recounts working\n              for different companies, including Klein Brothers and Metro Candy Company, before\n              learning the pressing trade from his brother. He recounts working as a presser in\n              different factories in the garment industry, including Levine Dress Company, Henry\n              Goldstein, Glassman and Prince, and Geoffrey Beene, before opening his own factory.

He especially emphasizes the contrast between the ideal\n              of the American melting pot and the reality of the discrimination he and many other\n              immigrants faced, recalling tension among the various European nationalities that\n              settled in Brooklyn. He explains that the membership of some ILGWU locals consisted\n              exclusively of a particular nationality. He notes that union educational and social\n              activities alleviated tension between ethnic groups. Currieri and his wife discuss the\n              role of women in the factories; the different jobs that they held; and the\n              unemployment gaps that permeated their careers due to marriage and caring for their\n              children."

Two unidentified people interject comments\n              throughout the interview. The interview covers Ethel Davidson's immigration to the\n              United States (US); her working life; and her union activity. Davidson describes her\n              unpleasant experience traveling in steerage to the US and her pride in being able to\n              save enough money to buy first class passage for her mother and seven siblings. She\n              recalls working in different garment factories in New York, New York; learning to use\n              a sewing machine; working with Jewish and Italian women; and overcoming the language\n              barrier between herself and the Italians. She discusses her membership in an\n              unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union), including\n              participating in strikes and organizing shops for the union. Other topics include\n              Davidson's attempts to attend an unspecified night school in the US, despite multiple\n              physical attacks by anti-Semitic boys at the school; wrapping candy and picking apples\n              as a child in Belarus; and attending the opera and concerts at the Metropolitan Opera\n              House and Carnegie Hall in Manhattan."

The date is unknown, and the location\n              is likely the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1814 Union Hall in\n              Brooklyn, New York. The interview covers Vincent DeMatteis' family and his working\n              life. DeMatteis discusses his father, including his work as a real estate agent in\n              Italy; his immigration to the United States (US); and his work as a longshoreman.\n              DeMatteis describes his own apprenticeship to a jeweler, including some of the\n              training he received. He discusses his decision to become a longshoreman, against his\n              father's wishes, as he was unable to find work as a jeweler during the Great\n              Depression. He describes different jobs longshoremen performed, including unloading,\n              checking, and sorting goods from ships. He discusses differences on the waterfront\n              between the 1930s and the time of the interview, many of them being the result of the\n              the creation of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor in 1953 and the success\n              of the International Longshoremen's Association in the 1960s in organizing the\n              workers. He discusses the structure of the work day; the way in which jobs were\n              distributed; the way men obtained jobs as longshoremen; and the way ships were\n              unloaded. He discusses the ways in which longshoremen kept busy on days when there was\n              no work; DeMatteis' household chores on those days; and the ethnic demographics of the\n              piers in New York, most of which were controlled by Italians. He discusses attempts at\n              unionization on the waterfront; workers who wished for stronger unions being labeled\n              communists; and the success of the ILA in the 1960s."

Topics\n              discussed include Vincent DePalo's childhood, his immigration to the United States\n              (US), his family life, and his work experiences. DePalo discusses his early life in\n              Italy, including being forced to leave school in order to learn stone cutting from his\n              grandfather, and working building sidewalks and mansions. His earliest memories of New\n              York, New York include living with his grandmother; his father working out of town;\n              lying about his age to get his first job making macaroni dies; and being surprised at\n              the ready availability of food. DePalo discusses owning a macaroni die company and the\n              other good opportunities he found in America. DePalo discusses in great detail his\n              family life including meeting his wife; gaining permission to court her; enduring\n              miscarriages and other problems concerning children; having two sons; and attending\n              the Italian Opera every week. He briefly discusses the CIAO Center, including his\n              enjoyment at being able to talk to the people there and the reasons that he\n              joined."

The audio recording for this interview is missing. This interview covers\n              Vincenzo DeRosa's childhood in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US) in\n              1903; and his work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn, New York. DeRosa begins by\n              describing the beautiful landscapes of his hometown. He recalls that he immigrated to\n              the US in order to make a fortune and traveled with one of his cousins because he was\n              too young to go by himself. He settled in Brooklyn with his brother and other\n              countrymen from Naples. He describes the development of the longshoremen's union to\n              which he belonged (likely the likely the International Longshoremen's Association\n              (ILA)); the ethnic composition of the longshoremen; and the tension between Irish and\n              Italian immigrants. Other topics include a comparison between Brooklyn in the past and\n              at the time of the interview; his children's occupations; his religious and political\n              affiliations; his regret at never having returned to Italy; and his love for\n              America."

The interview covers Moe Diamond's career as a garment worker and a member\n              of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU). Diamond discusses the\n              history of the ILGWU, beginning with a strike of needleworkers in 1910 and the\n              conditions that led to the strike; the conditions at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company\n              that contributed to the high casualty rate in the fire in 1911; the ways in which\n              conditions in factories changed after both of these events; and the ways in which\n              Meyer London and Morris Hillquit helped to strengthen the ILGWU. Other topics include\n              garment factories in which Diamond worked and the workers in the factories; the\n              importance of the Educational Alliance in Manhattan, New York to union members in the\n              early 20th century; changes in the garment industry between the 1910s and the 1970s;\n              and the changes in the Garment District neighborhood of Manhattan, New York."

The interview covers Eugene R. Duffy's childhood; work; and leisure time in\n              New York, New York. The volume of the recording fluctuates throughout the interview,\n              and background noise sometimes makes Duffy hard to hear. Duffy recounts his parents'\n              immigration to the US from Ireland in order to better themselves; that they were the\n              first members of their family to immigrate; and that they aided the rest of their\n              family in immigrating and finding work in New York. He recalls working in an\n              unspecified wallpaper factory and on tugboats and yachts, explaining that there were\n              few if any strikes in either industry. Other topics include his family's religious and\n              political affiliations; his visits to vaudeville shows and Central Park during his\n              leisure time; and a comparison of the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan in the past\n              and at the time of the interview."

Duffy begins by describing his hometown of Dundalk, Ireland,\n              emphasizing the town's position as a thriving railroad junction and its various\n              industries including shoe and tobacco manufacturing (specifically P.J. Carroll \u0026\n              Company Limited). He recalls the railroad being the major source of commerce and both\n              his father and his grandfather working on the railroad. He describes patterns of Irish\n              immigration to the US, noting that many of the immigrants came from the western and\n              southern towns in Ireland; that the Irish did not often immigrate as a family unit;\n              the effects of religious and political conflicts on immigration; and the often\n              contentious relationship between the Irish people and the English authorities."

He explains that he immigrated because he had a\n              desire to travel and he recounts living with an uncle before moving to a boarding\n              house on East 49th Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan. He focuses on his work in the\n              supply department at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan, emphasizing the mistreatment of\n              workers in other departments in the store; the lack of job security; and the lack of\n              stable promotion tracks for workers. He explains that all of these factors contributed\n              to the union organization of retail workers in the store, specifically through Local\n              65 of an unspecified retail workers' union (likely the Retail, Wholesale and\n              Department Store Union). He emphasizes the fragility of the early years of the union,\n              describing tension among members when Bloomingdale's gave the workers a raise and had\n              the union disperse the raises from a lump sum.

Other\n              topics include religious, ethnic, and racial divisions in the workforce, particularly\n              in the retail industry, and the negative relationship between Duffy's parish church\n              and the Communist Party of the United States of America."

The date of the interview is unknown. The\n              interview covers Sonia Farber's early life in Kiev, Russia; her political activity;\n              her immigration to the United States (US); her first impressions of New York City; and\n              her working life. Farber describes her childhood in Kiev, including her education at a\n              private school and obtaining the patronage of a wealthy neighbor who paid her tuition.\n              She describes the Pale of Settlement in Russia, explaining in which cities Jews were\n              allowed to live. She discusses her involvement as a teenager in an anarchist movement\n              in Kiev and the terrorist and syndicalist movements within it. She describes her\n              immigration to the US, including being delayed and having to travel back into eastern\n              Europe due to illness; losing tickets and luggage due to the delays and backtracking;\n              and traveling in first and third class. She describes her first jobs in New York City,\n              including pretending to know how to sew in order to secure a job and working as a\n              finisher in a skirt factory. In describing her union activity, she recounts attempting\n              to organize the skirt factory and joining the International Ladies' Garment Workers'\n              Union (ILGWU). She relates the early history of the ILGWU and mentions being a member\n              of the Executive and Joint Boards of the ILGWU."

The interview covers Farkas'\n              early life in Poland, her immigration to the United States (US), her working life, and\n              her union activity. She describes life in her town during and after World War I,\n              including occupation by German soldiers and rising anti-Semitism in the town after\n              Poland gained its independence from the Russian Empire in 1918. She describes her\n              immigration to the US and her happiness in coming to the US. She recalls living in the\n              Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan and in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn and\n              her preference for Harlem. She discusses working for private dressmakers and traveling\n              from Williamsburg into lower Manhattan to work. She discusses her membership in an\n              unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union); the\n              differences in working for a union shop and a non-union shop; and strikes in which she\n              was involved during the 1930s."

The interview covers\n              Feldstein's life in Russia and France, her immigration to the United States, her\n              working life, and her family. Feldstein recounts some of her family's experiences\n              during the First Balkan War, World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the pogroms in\n              1919, and the fact that these events led to her family's emigration from Russia. She\n              recounts the route through which they fled Russia, including waiting in Warsaw, Poland\n              for visas. She describes her life in Paris, France, including meeting her husband and\n              working in a cap factory. She recalls her first impressions of New York, New York as\n              unfavorable, particularly in comparison to Paris. She describes her apartments in the\n              Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. She discusses her work as a machine\n              operator in garment factories in Brooklyn and New Jersey. Other topics include\n              traveling to Moscow, Paris, and Israel after her retirement and reading the works of\n              Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn."

Mario Cinisomo and Rosario\n              Ferrentino discuss the different types of work done by longshoremen; the fact that\n              each job had different levels of danger; that some jobs were dependent on the weather;\n              and that all jobs were supervised differently by the foremen. They recall that in the\n              early 1920s, workers usually worked one or two days a week, increasing to three or\n              four days a week before the Great Depression; that during the Great Depression\n              employment opportunities were limited; that work was steady after the Great\n              Depression; and, at the time of the interview, there was more stability in the field\n              because of rules implemented by the ILA. Cinisomo recalls standing on the corner of\n              Columbia Street and President Street at five in the morning in an attempt to be hired\n              each day, and going to each dock if he was not hired on the corner. He explains that\n              some workers were hired as a group rather than individually. Ferrentino discusses\n              occasionally working a full day but only getting paid for half and making 36 cents an\n              hour. Cinisomo and Ferrentino discuss workplace accidents, including winches falling\n              out of gear and boxes falling on workers. They discuss their belief that accidents\n              were unavoidable in the industry and the fact that there was little or no injury\n              compensation. "

The interviewer and date are unknown, as is the first\n              name of the narrator. The main topics of the interview include Mr. Fields' life in\n              Austria-Hungary; his immigration to, first impressions of, and early experiences in\n              the United States (US); his employment; his leisure activities; and his living\n              situation in the US. Fields recalls his early life in Vienna, Austria-Hungary,\n              including his father's employment with the Hamburg America Line; his memories of the\n              1918 flu epidemic; his employment by two of the major banks in Austria; and the\n              effects of the 1929 stock market crash on his work in Vienna. He discusses his\n              immigration to the US, including his loneliness and seasickness during the voyage, and\n              his belief that he would have died in the Nazi concentration camps had he not left\n              Austria-Hungary. Fields' first impressions of the US include feeling comfortable in\n              New York, New York because he had seen it in movies; realizing that his immigrant\n              status would prevent him from finding employment commensurate with his experience; and\n              prioritizing finding a job and a place to live.

The interview covers Maria\n              Fischetti's early life in Italy, her immigration to the United States (US), her\n              working life, and her family. Fischetti discusses her early life in Sant'Angelo de\n              Lombardi, Italy, including her family's vineyard and her courtship and marriage. She\n              discusses her husband's immigration to the US; his work as a peddler and construction\n              worker in the US; and her life with his parents before her immigration in 1920. She\n              discusses joining the workforce after her children were grown and working in garment\n              factories making sweaters, ladies' coats, and men's suits. She discusses her husband's\n              illness after she returned to work and his willingness to do housework while she was\n              at work. Other topics include her religion; her children; differences in South\n              Brooklyn over the 50 years she lived there; and her volunteer work at CIAO."

Fox's\n              accent, his tendency to mumble, and the fluctuation of volume over the course of the\n              interview make him hard to understand. The interview covers Fox's childhood in Russia;\n              his immigration to the United States (US) in 1906; and his work in the garment\n              industry in New York, New York. Fox begins the interview by describing his childhood\n              in Russia, focusing on anti-Semitism in his hometown, which included pogroms and abuse\n              by the police. He recounts not being paid during the three years of his tailoring\n              apprenticeship and receiving meager pay for his long hours of work after his\n              apprenticeship. He recounts the Socialist Revolutionary Party meeting at his house and\n              learning more about Socialism at the library until his library card was destroyed when\n              it was learned that he was Jewish.

He\n              discusses living with his aunt's family on the East Side of Manhattan, recalling his\n              acclimation to the spring weather and the low cost of food in New York City. He\n              describes his first job in a garment shop in New York City and explains that, in the\n              beginning, he had to bring his own machine to work. He notes that although he joined\n              the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 23 in order to fight\n              for better wages, hours, and working conditions, change was slow due to factions\n              within the union and corruption among the union leaders. He recalls a strike that\n              occurred in the early 1950s, through which workers acquired a twenty percent wage\n              increase despite conflicts with strikebreakers brought in from Chicago, Illinois. He\n              discusses the ILGWU opening a school to train machine operators and the union becoming\n              more inclusive, particularly in terms of the Italian population's involvement. He\n              explains that different skill levels and job types had different wage standards in the\n              union and discusses working conditions in the garment shops. He recounts that he\n              established a ready-made garment store on Pitkin Avenue in Brooklyn with his brother\n              and step-father, noting that the people paid to guard the store broke in and stole all\n              the merchandise.

Fox discusses her life in Saint Kitts and Nevis,\n              including being the youngest of seven children; her father working as a carpenter and\n              being away from the family because of his work; and learning to read, write, and\n              perform multiplication and division by the age of four. She recalls beginning the\n              process of becoming a teacher in the British West Indies at 15 years old, and becoming\n              frustrated with her lack of advancement after teaching for over 20 years. She mentions\n              her immigration; the fact that she initially came to the US with no intention of\n              staying permanently; and the fact that she was required to leave the country through\n              Canada before she could become a citizen. She recounts living with her two older\n              sisters in the US, and feeling that she was imposing because she was over 40 years old\n              when she immigrated. She discusses having trouble finding well paying work; receiving\n              a certificate to be a pediatric nurses' aide; and studying early childhood education\n              at Fordham University in the Bronx. She discusses working for hospitals such as the\n              Flowers Fifth Avenue Hospital in Valhalla, New York; St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan,\n              New York; and Morrisania Hospital in the Bronx, New York."

She also mentions that she\n              still worked for the Local 1199 at the time of the interview as a corresponding\n              secretary, sending birthday cards to retirees; attending conferences; and serving on a\n              number of committees."

This interview covers Corrado Frasca's childhood\n              in Pollago Italy; his illegal immigration to the United States (US) in 1926; and his\n              life and work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn. Frasca begins this interview by\n              describing his childhood in Pollago, Italy, recalling doing simple jobs for the local\n              fishermen and seamen when he was eight years old. He explains that he moved to Genoa\n              when he was twelve and worked for several years aboard a passenger ship. He discusses\n              an uncle in New York encouraging him to come to the United States, and Frasca jumping\n              ship in Norfolk, Virginia in 1926. He describes traveling to Baltimore, Maryland to\n              avoid the authorities and locals who spoke Italian coming to his aid by giving him\n              room and board free of charge. Frasca explains that his uncle brought him to Brooklyn\n              where he began working as a longshoreman. He describes shifting occupations depending\n              on the seasons; working on ships going to South America in the winter; working as a\n              longshoreman in Brooklyn during the rest of the year; and later establishing his own\n              business as a peddler and fruit seller. Frasca mentions joining a club established by\n              immigrants from his hometown and the club providing social and fiscal support to its\n              members during hard times. He describes how he met his wife, an American citizen,\n              through his uncle, who served as a matchmaker in their apartment building. "

He describes the differences between his generation and his son's\n              generation, noting his opinion that the younger generation is less social and less\n              attached to traditional family values."

The interview\n              covers Mary MacCarthy Galinas' early life in Ireland and Great Britain, her\n              immigration to the United States (US), her working life, and her family. Galinas\n              recounts leaving her home in County Kerry, Ireland to care for her uncle's family in\n              Dublin; moving to London, England to live with her sister; and remembering London as a\n              place where British, Irish, and Scots all lived together harmoniously. She recounts\n              her pride in being able to save a great deal of money before immigrating to the US.\n              Topics regarding her life in Boston, Massachusetts include meeting her husband in one\n              of the restaurants where she worked; continuing to work after her marriage and the\n              birth of her daughter; and being unable to continue to save money after her marriage\n              and the theft of her savings. Her discussion of New York, New York includes her\n              decision to move there in the 1940s to gain better education opportunities for her\n              daughter."

The first interview was conducted by Rosenberg and Hirsch at an\n              unknown location. A man identified as John also contributes to the interview. The\n              second interview was conducted by Rosenberg at Jimmy Gavin's home in Brooklyn, New\n              York. The volume of the recording fluctuates throughout the interview. This interview\n              covers Gavin's childhood in Ireland; his involvement in the Irish War of Independence\n              and the Irish Civil War; his immigration to the United States (US); and his work as a\n              boatswain and an organizer for both the International Seamen's Union of America (ISU)\n              and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Gavin begins by explaining that he\n              does not believe that the working class knows its own history, providing a timeline of\n              events that he considers important to the development of the working class. He\n              describes his childhood in Ireland, recalling his attendance at an English national\n              school; his love of the Gaelic language and Irish history and literature; fishing and\n              hunting trips; and the contrast between his father, who was a Marxist and\n              anti-religion, and his mother, a devout Catholic. He describes joining the Irish\n              Republican Army (IRA); leaving home at his father's behest in order to protect his\n              family; not having a permanent home; learning how to use a gun; switching sides\n              various times over the course of both the the Irish War of Independence and the Irish\n              Civil War; and returning briefly to his home after he was declared dead.

He recalls writing to an aunt\n              in the US who sent him the money to immigrate. He explains that he initially settled\n              in Chicago, Illinois, where he worked transferring freight from boats. He describes\n              his time working for the United States Coast Guard; the development of the ISU; his\n              move to New York, New York; his contribution to organizing the Seamen's Unemployment\n              Council in 1932; and various strikes for better conditions, particularly in terms of\n              food quality and working hours. Other topics include his opinions on politicians and\n              journalists; his political views; his work dissuading strikebreakers from occupying\n              positions that union workers had vacated while on strike; and his trips across the US\n              to organize labor unions.

The majority of this interview, covering\n              the first 25 years of Amelia Geiss' life, was not recorded. Topics covered include\n              Geiss' relationship with her husband; her experiences during the Great Depression;\n              racial and ethnic tensions in her community in New York, New York; and her work at the\n              Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center. Geiss spends the majority of the interview\n              discussing her relationship with her husband, Bill, including how he was separated\n              from his first wife when they first began their relationship; the fact that his\n              estranged wife stalked Geiss; and the fact that she moved multiple times to escape\n              this harassment. She discusses her husband's work as an electrician at the Brooklyn\n              Navy Yard. She recalls that they survived the Great Depression due to the fact that\n              they both were able to work. She discusses the community she lived in at the time of\n              the interview, including how ethnic discrimination had gotten worse over time, and\n              that the community had more problems at the time of the interview because it was no\n              longer predominantly German. She discusses her volunteer work at the Stanley M. Isaacs\n              Neighborhood Center, including the fact that she joined so that she and her husband\n              would not fight after they retired; her fundraising efforts; both she and her husband\n              being recognized by New York City for their work at the Center; and her participation\n              on the Board of Directors."

The volume of the recording fluctuates, and there are large\n              spaces of dead air between some sections. This interview covers Bessie Geller's\n              childhood in Russia; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1912; and her\n              participation in Socialism, Anarchism, and other radical political movements. Geller\n              describes her father's reluctance to let her attend school in Russia, explaining that\n              he believed that she would never find a husband if she was educated. She notes that\n              the schools near her town were a privilege primarily for the children of the wealthy\n              and not for Jewish children, but she recalls that her mother aided her in finding a\n              tutor who instructed her in Russian, literature, and other subjects. She recounts\n              wanting to immigrate to the US because she wanted to become independent from her\n              parents; broaden the scope of her studies; and avoid an arranged marriage. She\n              describes immigrating to the US with her sister and friend in 1912 and her mother\n              convincing her father to sell his business and immigrate to the US with the rest of\n              the family a year later.

The\n              interview covers Grace Gelo's childhood in Tunis, Tunisia; her immigration to the\n              United States (US); her working life; her husband's union and political activity; and\n              their children. Gelo discusses her childhood in Tunis, including her education and her\n              parents' backgrounds. She provides a short history of the colonization of Tunisia and\n              of the ethnic groups in Tunis. She discusses her family's immigration to the US and\n              the ethnic groups in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. She\n              discusses her strict upbringing and rules her father imposed upon her; her courtship\n              with her husband under these rules; and her younger sister's rebellion against the\n              rules. She discusses having to leave school in order to work to support her family and\n              working as a finisher on men's clothes. She describes the first factory in which she\n              worked; the ethnic demographics of the workers, mainly Italian and Jewish, and the\n              language barrier between the two groups; and her unhappiness in her work and her\n              difficulty communicating with the Jewish workers. She describes working conditions in\n              the factories; her dissatisfaction with them; and her opinion that the workers were\n              seriously mistreated. "

One of Glick's grandsons assists in the interview but is not\n              identified by name. The interview covers Glick's childhood in Vilna, Russia; his\n              immigration to the United States (US); his working life; and his family. Glick\n              discusses his education at a cheder in Vilna until the age of 18 and at a university\n              in Dvinsk, Russia where he studied chemistry and trained as a dyer. He discusses his\n              wife and mother-in-law deciding for him to immigrate to the US in order to avoid being\n              drafted into the Russian Army; living with his wife's relatives in the US; and his\n              wife's uncle deciding he should change his name from Gleot to Glick because it was\n              easier to spell. He recounts finding and losing jobs in different industries before\n              settling in the dry cleaning industry; the salary he received; and the number of days\n              he worked per week at these jobs. He discusses borrowing money in order to bring his\n              wife and son over to the US and living in the Lower East Side neighborhood of\n              Manhattan. He recounts his business ventures, including buying two dry cleaning stores\n              in Manhattan and buying and selling dry cleaning stores in order to make a profit.\n              Other topics include attending movies and the Yiddish theater on Sundays and\n              collecting clothes from customers with a horse and wagon in the Brownsville\n              neighborhood of Brooklyn."

The main topics\n              discussed include Rose Godet's childhood in the Dominican Republic, her feelings about\n              immigrating to the United States (US), her work experience, and her personal\n              experiences in New York, New York. Godet begins by discussing her early life in the\n              Dominican Republic, including being of French descent; speaking multiple languages;\n              and her father working for the Puccini Shipping Company. Her early experiences in New\n              York City include living on 140th Street in Manhattan; deciding to only live in\n              Manhattan; disliking living in the US initially because she had never worked before;\n              feeling lonely in the city; and finding the US to be substantially more expensive than\n              the Dominican Republic. Godet discusses her confusion regarding segregation, having\n              never witnessed white flight before coming to the US. She discusses her personal\n              experiences during the Prohibition era and the Great Depression, including an Irish\n              friend giving her bootleg liquor, though she did not like the taste; enjoying visiting\n              speakeasies; and being employed pressing silk underwear. She talks about World War II\n              and her fear of air raid drills; that minimum wage requirements implemented by\n              Franklin Roosevelt were not enforced; and her belief that the US government would pull\n              men off the streets and force them into the military. She notes her work experience,\n              which included working as a saleswoman and interpreter for the Charles Broadway Rouss\n              department store on Broadway in Manhattan and learning to type in order to work for a\n              mail order company translating orders received in Spanish or French. She discusses her\n              employment at the National Biscuit Company packing cookies after she began to lose her\n              eyesight, and feeling exploited by the company due to the minimal vacation time, long\n              hours, and low wages."

The interview covers Minna Goldman's multiple immigrations to the United\n              States (US) and returns to Romania, her working life in both countries, and her\n              extended family. Goldman discusses her multiple immigrations to the US between 1907\n              and 1920 and her reasons for returning to Romania before permanently settling in the\n              US in 1920. She discusses the pogrom that led to her initial immigration with her\n              father and one of her brothers in 1907; the death of her brother during their travels;\n              and her father's decision to return to Romania after six months in US. She discusses\n              her father's work as an umbrella maker and his decision to send her to work rather\n              than school, in order to save money for their return to Romania. She describes her\n              unhappiness at having to leave the US as she felt it had a more egalitarian society\n              than Romania. She recalls her decision to return to the US in 1910 and forego her\n              education in order to work and save money to send to her family in Romania. She\n              describes her work refurbishing old umbrellas and recalls her decision to return to\n              Romania when her family decided not to immigrate to the US. "

She immigrated to the United States (US) and returned to\n              Romania twice before settling permanently in the US. Her first immigration to the US\n              was in 1907 with her father and younger brother, who died in the Netherlands during\n              their travels.

They returned to\n              Romania after six months in the US. Goldman returned to the US in 1910 with a cousin\n              and worked refurbishing old umbrellas. She saved enough money to buy passage for her\n              parents and five siblings though they declined to travel. She returned to Romania in\n              1912 and resumed her education. After leaving school, she worked in a foreign language\n              bookstore and for the American Red Cross in Bucharest.

They discuss their early lives in\n              Gorlice, including the differences in their educations and the living arrangements of\n              their family. They discuss the differences between religious and secular schools,\n              including the curricula; the fact that only the most religious boys attended the\n              religious schools; and games they would play during recess. Goldman and Shapiro\n              describe Gorlice; the fact that Jews lived among other religious groups in the town;\n              the relationship between the two groups, including anti-Semitism; the social hierarchy\n              amongst the Jewish residents; and the layout and architecture of the town. They\n              discuss their religious upbringing, in particular the separation between men and women\n              and the fact that women were not required to attend religious services. "

Topics include Goren's childhood in Russia, her immigration to\n              the United States (US), and her life in the US. Goren discusses her childhood in\n              Pinsk, Russia, including her family; her neighborhood; the hierarchy amongst Jews in\n              the area; her education in religious and public schools; and the differences in\n              education for boys and girls. She discusses religion, including her family being\n              extremely religious and the difference in religious observance between men and women.\n              She discusses her family's decision to immigrate to the US due to rising anti-Semitism\n              and pogroms in Pinsk, and the outbreak of World War I. She recounts hiding during\n              pogroms, sometimes with the aid of Catholic priests in her neighborhood. She describes\n              her father's potato farm, including the ownership of the land and her father's lease\n              on it; her management of the laborers, who were not Jewish; and the relationship\n              between herself and the laborers. She describes the industries in Pinsk and the types\n              of people employed in the factories. She discusses reactions to the Russian Revolution\n              in Pinsk and her family's decision to immigrate soon after the Revolution. She\n              discusses her family's chain of immigration and two of her brothers who lived in the\n              US assisting her immigration. "

Goren discusses his early life in David-Gorodok, including his education\n              and his participation in a local smuggling operation. He describes David-Gorodok,\n              including the fact that Jews lived among other religious groups in town; the fact that\n              anti-Semitism was common; the social hierarchy amongst the Jewish residents; political\n              instability, due to control of the town being passed between different Russian gangs;\n              and the participation of the residents in the Zionist movement and the General Jewish\n              Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland and Russia. He describes his immigration to the US\n              and the fact that it coincided with a general emigration of Jews from his town. He\n              discusses his family's assimilation in the US and their desire to leave behind all\n              associations from the old world."

He discusses his movement through the fur industry, including opening his own\n              fur shop on 7th Avenue in the Fur District neighborhood of Manhattan. He states that\n              after the World War II, the racial and ethnic demographics of the industry changed\n              from being predominantly Eastern European Jews to include more African American,\n              Greek, and Puerto Rican employees. He describes the atmosphere in the factories and\n              the relationship of the different ethnic and racial groups as amicable. He describes\n              the conditions in the factories as poor but notes that he did not mind since he was\n              happy simply to be in the US. He discusses the role of labor unions in the fur\n              industry, including his membership in the International Fur and Leather Workers Union\n              of the United States and Canada; his participation in strikes; attacks on\n              strikebreakers by union members; and general violence during the strikes.

The\n              location is likely the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) Union Hall on\n              Court Street in Brooklyn, New York. Topics include Dominick Granato's life in Sicily,\n              Italy; his family; and his work as a longshoreman. Granato recalls being a member of\n              the Italian Navy from 1914 to 1919; immigrating to the United States (US) and settling\n              in Omaha, Nebraska in 1920; and working in Nebraska for four years before returning to\n              Sicily. He discusses marrying his wife during his return to Italy; remaining in Sicily\n              for less than a year before returning to the US; and having three children. He\n              describes his work as a longshoreman; joining the ILA in 1925; working in Hoboken, New\n              Jersey and Staten Island, New York, as well as many piers in New York City; moving\n              bags of sugar and cement for transport to the Panama Canal; standing on Columbia\n              Street in Brooklyn in an attempt to find work; and making approximately 60 cents an\n              hour. He also discusses working for the Works Progress Administration during the Great\n              Depression; retiring in 1960; and receiving 175 dollars a month through his\n              pension."

He recalls warnings about the differences between people in New\n              York and in the south, and tales of pickpockets upon his arrival in the city. He\n              recounts the various jobs he held before working in Montefiore Hospital, including\n              dock worker; peddler; building superintendent and porter; and handyman. He discusses\n              the impact that religion had on both his and his father's lives; his father's\n              conversion to Christianity and job as a deacon; and the church's role in disseminating\n              and giving credence to the ideas that it was natural for black community members to\n              feel inferior as minorities and that it was impossible to live Christian life in the\n              northern United States (US). He recalls that living outside of the southern US gave\n              him a broader perspective concerning racial relations, prompting him to adopt the\n              belief that all people are equal."

He recounts not encountering much racial\n              discrimination in the northern US but attributes this to the fact that he was poor and\n              did not have occasion to go to places that were likely to be segregated. He explains\n              that he would generally stay in areas with a majority black population and not put\n              himself in a position in which he was likely to face discrimination and prejudice,\n              although he does recount two incidents of discrimination he faced in New York. He\n              discusses jobs he had as a building superintendent in Manhattan, including his\n              responsibilities; the types of people for whom he worked; and issues he had at the\n              buildings regarding an unspecified building workers union.

The date is unknown. This interview covers\n              Greenfield's childhood in Hungary; her immigration to the United States (US) in the\n              1920s; and her life and work in the garment industry in New York, New York. Greenfield\n              begins the interview by discussing her love of the US, emphasizing the importance of\n              freedom and economic opportunities. She explains that the population of Hungary was\n              split between the poor and the rich; that the poor could not afford to send their\n              children to school; and that one could not marry outside of her class. She recounts\n              her father's conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army and capture by Russian forces\n              in 1914; his six years as a prisoner of war; and her mother's decision to disperse her\n              children to the care of her sisters in order to keep them safe. She recalls her move\n              to the Czecho-Slovak region of Austria-Hungary during the course of World War I. She\n              focuses on the opportunities afforded to the Jewish population there, citing her\n              sisters' educations; free disability and sick leave benefits for workers; and Tomáš\n              Garrigue Masaryk's policies that provided food and education for the young. She\n              explains that she wanted to immigrate to the US in order to attend school and aid her\n              family but notes that her father disapproved because he believed she would lose her\n              religion if she went.

She explains that she originally lived with\n              her cousins in Sunbury, Pennsylvania but moved to live with a friend on East 10th\n              Street in Manhattan. She describes her awe upon first observing the amount of people\n              living in New York City and a strike that occurred the day she arrived. She explains\n              that she worked predominantly in the garment industry, recalling that she was not paid\n              at her first job on 38th Street and Broadway in order to learn the trade. She recounts\n              her supervisor at a dress house at 1400 Broadway giving her six months' paid vacation\n              in order to visit her family in Hungary. She recalls joining an unspecified union\n              (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and acquiring better wages\n              and hours. She describes earning enough money that she was able to pay her cousin back\n              for the cost of the fare to the US and even help send her brother to university in\n              Czechoslovakia, emphasizing the fact that she always kept her family in mind. Other\n              topics include the role Greenfield's parents played in developing her spirituality;\n              her trips back to Hungary; the fate of family members that remained in Hungary during\n              World War II; the friends she made in New York City; a comparison of Jewish children's\n              behaviors with the behaviors of children from other religious groups; and her view\n              regarding the refusal of many young people to go to war (presumably with Vietnam) at\n              the time of the interview."

He recalls in detail his education, discussing the different public schools\n              he attended, including Public School 158 in Manhattan, and Boys High School in\n              Brooklyn; being involved with the debate team, as well as athletics such as baseball,\n              football, and track; the racial integration of athletic teams and other\n              extracurricular activities; and the lack of black teachers. His memories of World War\n              I include joining the 15th New York National Guard Regiment; moving to different parts\n              of the east coast of the United States for training; the racism he experienced while\n              training on a base in Spartanburg, South Carolina (likely Camp Croft); fighting in the\n              trenches in France; and receiving the Purple Heart after being wounded in Argonne,\n              France.

He mentions\n              that the church was the center of most of the community's social activities. He\n              discusses the Great Depression, including the fact that the Ozone Park neighborhood\n              was not affected as much as other neighborhoods; that his family helped the few\n              families in need both financially and with food; and that even those in the community\n              who needed relief were better off than others in New York City. He discusses politics\n              in New York City, including the fact that his community strongly supported Fiorello La\n              Guardia; that Woodrow Wilson was well respected; that Republican presidents after\n              Warren G. Harding were not trusted; his opinions of the Teapot Dome Scandal; and his\n              involvement in the Queens County Colored Democratic Organization."

The main topics of this interview include Harris'\n              childhood in Jamaica; his work at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, New York; his\n              union activity; and his political ideologies. Harris discusses his childhood in\n              Jamaica, including not having any siblings; his mother living in Panama; his father\n              dying when Harris was seven years old; and his aunt and cousin raising him. He recalls\n              his different jobs in Jamaica, which included farm worker, bank clerk, cook, and\n              employee of the US Consulate in Jamaica. He discusses his early experiences at\n              Montefiore Hospital, including living in the hospital dormitories for two years;\n              beginning his employment in the dietary unit delivering food to patients in a\n              tuberculosis ward; not planning on staying at Montefiore for an extended period of\n              time; and eventually feeling obligated to stay due to his loyalty to both the patients\n              and his co-workers.

The date and location of the interview are unknown. The interview covers\n              Shirley Harris' childhood in Poland and Austria, her working life, and her family.\n              Harris discusses her childhood in Poland and Austria; her religious upbringing; her\n              experiences during World War I; and her family's immigration to Austria after an\n              attack on their village by Russian troops. She discusses immigrating to the United\n              States with her mother and two siblings and joining the workforce as soon as she came\n              of age. She describes her first job in a dress factory working as a floor girl, sewing\n              belts onto dresses by hand. She discusses learning to use a sewing machine and\n              becoming a machine operator, which she preferred to sewing by hand. She discusses her\n              membership in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) and differences\n              in the ILGWU when she first joined and at the time of the interview. Other topics\n              include her distrust of politicians, except for Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom she\n              admired; the changing ethnic and racial demographics of the workforce of the garment\n              industry; and her daughter."

This interview covers Fanny Heltzer's childhood in Russia; her\n              immigration to the United States (US) in 1906; and her work in the garment industry\n              and as a private nurse in New York, New York. Heltzer begins the interview by\n              describing her childhood in Kiev, noting that conversations regarding politics were\n              forbidden in school; that she acquired her Socialist viewpoints from family and\n              friends; and that she attended secret Socialist meetings. She recalls that her mother\n              paid for her to be a live-in apprentice to a furrier in Kiev because her sister noted\n              the high-paying opportunities in that industry in the US. She describes her mother\n              sending Heltzer's oldest sister to the US in the hopes that she would eventually be\n              able to send for the rest of the family. She explains that her brother was sent to\n              Siberia due to his revolutionary activity and that their mother sent him to the United\n              States in order to prevent his being arrested again. She notes that she immigrated\n              soon after him in 1906, with their two remaining sisters following her. "

She\n              explains that she acquired her first job in a ladies' shirtwaist shop through the\n              recommendation of a friend, noting her initial fear of the speed and noise of the\n              electric sewing machines; that the conditions of the shop were filthy; and that she\n              quit because of the poor conditions and the long work week. She explains that her next\n              jobs in Manhattan, in a dress shop and at the Nemo Corset Company, were better due to\n              the cleaner conditions in the shops. She notes that employees at the Nemo Corset\n              Company were afraid to organize and join a union because of the potentially hostile\n              reaction from management. She emphasizes the development of the International Ladies'\n              Garment Workers' Union during her time in various garment shops, noting the union's\n              cocern over working conditions and lack of job security.

She explains that he invested in cotton\n              goods and lost nearly all of this money in a failed business venture in Worcester,\n              prompting the family to move back to New York City. She describes working as a machine\n              operator for the Works Progress Administration (WPA) through which she joined the\n              International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) and the Workers' Unemployed Union\n              (WUU), established in New York City by the Socialist Party of America. She recalls\n              moving through various neighborhoods in New York City in order to find better\n              employment and living conditions, focusing on her time working in her husband's\n              jewelry store on 41st Street and 10th Avenue. She explains that a robbery in the store\n              affected her husband's physical and mental health, prompting her to work at the store\n              by herself for two years before closing it. She emphasizes her family's involvement in\n              and bonding through the Socialist Party, noting that her children grew up around party\n              events due to her and her husband's labor union and other party activities.

The location is unknown.\n              The interview covers Astrid Henning's working life in Norway and the United States\n              (US) and her family. Henning discusses her family in Norway, including her parents'\n              occupations; her siblings; and her step-siblings. She discusses her first job in\n              Norway as a packer in a sardine factory; her decision to take the job because the\n              wages would enable her immigration to the US; the fact that the men in the factory\n              were unionized but that the women were not; and the fact that her salary enabled her\n              to travel to the US in comfort. She describes her reasons for wanting to immigrate to\n              the US, including the number of children in her family and her desire to travel. She\n              discusses the women with whom she immigrated and the fact that they knew they would\n              work in domestic service in the US, despite coming from middle-class backgrounds.

She describes her responsibilities and hours;\n              her feelings of isolation on Long Island; and her employers, including their behavior,\n              their homes, and parties they would host. She explains that she was not responsible\n              for heavy cleaning in any of her positions and that her responsibilities consisted\n              mainly of dusting, dishwashing, and serving. She describes the staff in the different\n              houses in which she worked, including the responsibilities of each staff member; the\n              types of people that were successful in domestic service; and advice she received from\n              co-workers. She compares the behavior of different ethnic groups in domestic service\n              and her disapproval of the Irish workers, who would swear while on duty and play cards\n              late at night. She describes the food that was provided for the staff at different\n              houses in which she worked, including one in which the staff was provided only with\n              leftovers until Henning complained. She recounts being repeatedly subjected to sexual\n              harassment by male employers and warning the men that she would quit if the behavior\n              continued. She describes the experiences of her sister and other women who were\n              sexually harassed and assaulted while in domestic service and their fear of losing\n              their jobs if they reported these incidents. She later recounts sexual harassment in\n              movie theaters and on the subway in New York City; her fear of being alone in public\n              because of these incidents; and the contrast between public behavior in the US and\n              Norway.

The interview covers Anna Herzog's life in\n              Minsk, Russia, her immigration to the United States (US), her involvement in union\n              activities and strikes, and her personal life. Herzog recollects her early life in\n              Minsk, including her father dying when she was three years old; her brother serving as\n              a father figure; Jewish children not being allowed to attend school; wanting to play\n              instead of work; and working for a year in a garment factory on a pedal sewing\n              machine. Her first memories of New York, New York include learning English through\n              friends, and being overwhelmed with the size of New York City. She remembers needing\n              to supply her own sewing machine at her first job; and requiring assistance carrying\n              the sewing machine up and down the stairs. She recalls the differences between garment\n              work in Russia and the United States. She recalls a strike in 1911, during which the\n              workers went on strike for 15 days in order to achieve better pay, better working\n              conditions, and for owner-supplied sewing machines. Herzog's discussion of her\n              personal life includes meeting her husband and their wedding in Toronto, Canada;\n              having two sons and adopting her sister's daughter; discontinuing work because she was\n              pregnant; and moving to the Workmen's Circle Home against her son's wishes."

The interviewer is unknown. Main topics include Herzog's\n              life in Austrian Galicia; his education in the United States (US); and his leisure\n              activities, politics, and union activities. Herzog discusses his life in Galicia,\n              including working as a tinsmith with his father; belonging to an unspecified\n              metalworkers' union; and his father warning him not to join the Army. He recalls\n              learning English in the US through a librarian who would give him books in both\n              Yiddish and English; and attending night school. He discusses leisure activities in\n              which he participated, including going with his children to the park, beach, and\n              baseball games in Brooklyn, New York; having season tickets to the Metropolitan Opera\n              for 35 years; and enjoying attending symphony concerts. Herzog recalls knowing very\n              little about politics upon his arrival to the US; quickly coming to dislike the\n              Republican Party because they represented the rich; and being a member of the\n              Socialist Party of America for most of his life. He discusses his involvement with an\n              unspecified building trades union; his election as a trustee for his New York local;\n              his service on the examining board; and his belief that every worker should be a\n              member of a union."

He discusses his early experiences in New\n              York, including having no friends or family nearby and living in a community that\n              included Hungarians, Irish, and Germans. His early work experience includes being\n              employed by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company until he quit because his pay was less\n              than the other employees'. Higgins discusses stealing a hammer, chisel, and wrench in\n              order to work as a mechanic at a shipyard; working as a carpenter in order to make\n              money while on strike at the shipyard; and making good money at the shipyard because\n              he was willing to work long hours and overtime. He recollects being the chief engineer\n              for multiple hotels, including the St. Andrews Hotel in Manhattan for over 22 years;\n              never having problems finding work because other Irish immigrants would always help\n              him; and belonging to the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 30. He\n              recalls drinking at the pub with his friends; having negative feelings about\n              Prohibition; watching Irish football and hurling on Long Island on Sundays; and being\n              a member and secretary of the County Wexford Organization, which met on 59th Street in\n              Manhattan."

This interview covers Katherine Higgins' early life in Ireland, England, and\n              France; her work during and after World War I (WWI); her world travels; and her\n              religion. Higgins discusses her childhood in Ireland in great detail, including the\n              lives of her eight siblings; inheritance laws and her father's disinheritance due to\n              his choice of wife; and Higgins' family home in New Ross. Higgins remembers class\n              distinctions within her community; the education system in Ireland; and her opinion\n              that her life would have been boring had she attended college. She recalls living in\n              England, where she studied to be a teacher and worked for the British War Office\n              during WWI. She discusses the 1916 Easter Rising and its aftermath, including her\n              brother-in-law's wrongful incarceration for weapons possession; the hunger strike and\n              eventual death of Terence MacSwiney; and the fact that her family supported the\n              revolution but believed that it occurred too late. She discusses her work with the\n              United States Army Quartermaster Corps in France after WWI, designing cemeteries for\n              the reburial of American soldiers, and organizing a chapter of American Gold Star\n              Mothers. She explains that she immigrated to the United States (US) and settled in New\n              York, New York in 1933 because it was the only place she could find work. Her first\n              impressions of the US include her surprise at the bigotry towards the Irish and her\n              amazement at the poor education of American men. Higgins discusses her work as a\n              lady's companion, including attending the film premiere of ; visiting some of the Nordic countries, the Baltics, and the\n              Soviet Union; and enjoying the fact that her employer owned a car. She also discusses\n              her religious influences, practices, and ideologies, including the fact that she did\n              not practice Catholicism in the years between leaving Ireland and arriving in the US;\n              her opinion that the French were not devout Catholics; that she attended St. Patrick's\n              Cathedral in Manhattan; and the Irish fear of the afterlife.",

The main topics include Eddie Hochberg's\n              life in Russia; his immigration to the United States (US); his work in the garment\n              industry both in Russia and the US; and the internal organization of garment workers'\n              labor unions in New York, New York. Hochberg discusses his early life in Russia,\n              including his family's poverty and his father's work as a supervisor in a logging\n              company. He discusses the immigration of his family to the US, including his father\n              immigrating in 1911 and finding work in a paper box factory; two of his brothers\n              immigrating after their father; Hochberg immigrating alone in 1914; and the rest of\n              his family following in 1916. He describes finding his first job through a man with\n              whom he attended synagogue; not being paid for three weeks while he learned the trade;\n              and his first job turning over coats to create seams. He discusses his movement\n              through different factories within the garment industry and his work in each,\n              including manufacturing coats for men, cloaks, and dresses; being paid for both week\n              work and piecework; cleaning and oiling the machines every Friday; working overtime\n              during the busy season; and having to find other employment during the summer. He\n              describes the introduction of labor unions into the garment industry, including the\n              fact that very few companies were unionized initially; the establishment of the\n              National Recovery Administration in 1933 guaranteeing workers the right to join\n              unions; that different locals within the same international union being determined by\n              profession as well as ethnicity; and unions providing benefits such as better pay,\n              vacations, and pensions. Hochberg also mentions that he was a member of multiple\n              unions, including the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union Local 22, the\n              Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, and the United Brotherhood of Cloak Makers\n              Local 1."

The main topics discussed include Simon\n              Hoffman's life in Russia; his immigration to the United States (US) and his early days\n              there; his work in New York, New York; and leisure activities in which he\n              participated. Hoffman discusses his early life in Russia, including the fact that he\n              learned four languages despite not attending school; his work selling sewing notions;\n              and the fact that the Jewish community mixed with other local ethnic groups for\n              commerce but were otherwise segregated. He recalls his family, including the fact that\n              his father was a butcher and was substantially older than his mother; that his mother\n              regretted marrying an older man; his mother's work manufacturing wigs and hairpieces;\n              and his three siblings. He discusses his immigration to the US, including paying a\n              smuggler 25 rubles to help him cross the border between Russia and Germany; sailing on\n              the  from Bremen, Germany; being assisted by the\n              Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society after his arrival at Ellis Island, New York; and residing\n              with his step-siblings in the Bronx for a short time before finding work. Hoffman\n              recalls his employment in the US, including making hats on Houston Street in\n              Manhattan; receiving a pay increase during World War I; being employed by the City of\n              New York to clean public parks during the Depression; and resuming his employment in\n              the cap making industry in 1942. He mentions joining an unspecified cap makers' union\n              (likely United Hatters of North America) in 1915, and was proud of the fact that he\n              maintained his union membership after his retirement. Hoffman discusses his leisure\n              activities, including reading the , the\n                , and the ; visiting the Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of\n              Natural History in Manhattan; and attending the Jewish theater frequently.",

The first name of the narrator is unknown. Mr. Hoffzimmer reminisces\n              about his early life and immigration to the United States (US), including his father\n              being a cobbler; his father not teaching him the trade; and falsifying his immigration\n              papers to show that he was 16 years old in order to emigrate. He discusses the\n              immigration process at Ellis Island, New York, including a required medical\n              examination; the requirement of either $25 or someone to vouch for you; and\n              immigration societies that would vouch for individuals who knew no one in New York and\n              assist them with acquiring lodgings. His first impressions of New York City include\n              not feeling excited about living in New York; the abundance of poverty; and\n              hostilities between ethnic groups, especially between the Jewish and Irish\n              communities. He discusses his involvement with Socialism and the Socialist Party of\n              America, including attending lectures and meetings at the Rand School of Social\n              Science in Manhattan; his feelings about Social Security; society's lack of\n              appreciation for social programs at the time of the interview; and reading the\n              Socialist newspaper . Hoffzimmer\n              discusses his family, including meeting his wife through friends; and sending his\n              daughter to the Workmen's Circle to learn about Jewish language and culture. He\n              discusses his great appreciation for his wife; and the accomplishments of his\n              grandson. He recalls his work experience, in particular finding employment as a hatter\n              through his work manufacturing human hair goods. He describes traveling to the western\n              US and to Mexico with the money he saved at his first job. He recounts learning\n              Spanish and opening a business selling portraits while in Mexico; and opening his own\n              hattery upon his return to New York with the money he made. He also recalls not\n              requiring government assistance during the Great Depression because of his business;\n              discusses the benefits and drawbacks of modernization; and discusses his membership in\n              the United Hatters of North America.",

She\n              recounts living on 139th Street in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan with her\n              sisters in 1912; explains that African Americans were starting to move into Harlem at\n              that time; and describes Harlem as beautiful, brightly lit, and clean. She compares\n              the living situation of minorities in downtown Manhattan to those in Harlem and her\n              belief that the conditions downtown were more primitive than those in Hampton. She\n              compares her children's education to her own and discusses her opinion that she\n              received a much better education as her teachers were black, took great interest in\n              their students, and served as role models. She recounts an incident of racial\n              prejudice one of her children experienced, her reaction to it, and her feeling that\n              this exemplified the failing of the educational system in New York.

This compilation may have been created for a radio broadcast, but it is\n              unclear if it was ever broadcasted. The volume and sound quality of the recording\n              fluctuate between excerpts. The recording begins with an introduction to the project\n              by Scott Weir, and an unidentified female interviewer explains that the recording\n              addresses the experiences of three groups: Eastern European Jews; Italians; and\n              African-American migrants from the southern United States (US). She notes that the\n              excerpts reference the experiences of these groups in New York, New York; in\n              factories; and in the formation of unions. She describes the social, economic, and\n              political conditions that prompted many Eastern European Jews to immigrate to the US\n              and interview excerpts follow discussing anti-Semitism, religious traditions, and\n              education. Weir gives a brief history of Italian immigration to the US, and interview\n              excerpts that follow discuss the economic contrast between landowners and agricultural\n              laborers in Italy, and the fact that many Italians expected to return to Italy once\n              they had enough money. The last section of the recording contains interview excerpts\n              discussing the history of African Americans from Reconstruction to the 1970s; racial\n              discrimination; the sequence of family migration; and ethnic relations among people in\n              different New York City neighborhoods."

Ippolito's\n              wife, Stephanie, participates in the interview. The interview covers Ippolito's\n              immigration to the United States (US), his family, his working life, his union\n              activity, his social activities, and his political affiliation. Ippolito discusses his\n              family's staggered immigration to the US; his father's immigration seven years before\n              the rest of the family; and his father's work to bring the rest of the family to the\n              US. He discusses leaving school to join the workforce; working in a bed factory and\n              being told he was too young for that type of work; and finding a job in the furniture\n              industry through a friend. He recounts joining the United Furniture Workers of America\n              Local 76; participating in strikes; and losing a job as a result of one of the\n              strikes. He recounts working in a factory producing radio and television cabinets;\n              switching to war production during World War II and making uniforms for the United\n              States Army; and returning to production of television and radio cabinets after the\n              war. He lists furniture plants in which he worked; the dates of his employment; and\n              the types of furniture each produced. Ippolito and his wife describe the changes in\n              the ethnic composition of the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn between the early\n              20th century and in the 1960s when they decided to move to Ridgewood. He lists social\n              clubs to which belonged, including the Happy Hearts, and discusses support provided to\n              the poor by the Democratic Party."

The family lived in the\n              Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Ippolito attended school through the\n              eighth grade. He worked in a bed factory in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn\n              for a few years before getting a job in a furniture factory. He spent the bulk of his\n              career in the furniture industry. He was a member of the United Furniture Workers of\n              America (UFWA) Local 76 and was a shop steward in different factories between\n              1937-1965.

The interview covers Arno Jacobson's\n              childhood, his education, his working life, and his union activity. Jacobson describes\n              the types of people who lived in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and\n              friends he had in the neighborhood. He recalls that he was fearful as a child as a\n              result of his sheltered upbringing. He describes his father's work as a leather cutter\n              in handbag factories; a summer he worked with his father in one of these factories\n              when he was 16 years old; the difference in pay between skilled and unskilled\n              laborers; and racial discrimination amongst the workers. He describes his time at the\n              High School of Music and Art in Manhattan; how inclusive an environment it was; and\n              how it matured him. He discusses his decision to drop out of the City College of New\n              York and jobs he held subsequent to that decision. "

Wagner\n              Houses in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. The date and interviewer are\n              unknown. The main topics of discussion include Johns' early childhood and a comparison\n              of New York when he migrated and at the time of the interview. Johns discusses his\n              childhood in the southern United States (US), including his siblings and the death of\n              their father in 1928. Johns recalls growing up on a farm that produced cotton,\n              tobacco, corn, vegetables, and raised animals; and moving to New York in 1930 to find\n              work during the Great Depression. His earliest memories of New York City include\n              believing the apartment buildings were factories because he had never seen such tall\n              buildings; joining the Shiloh Baptist Church in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan\n              shortly after his migration; joining a Masonic Lodge in 1948; and paying six dollars\n              to an agency to find him a job. He compares New York City when he arrived and at the\n              time of the interview, including increased crime rates; the changing use of a\n              particular racial epithet; his opinion that children were not as well behaved as they\n              once were; his belief that making less money made people less greedy; and that the\n              younger generation does not know how to dance."

Johnson begins by discussing her early life in North Carolina, including her\n              multiple siblings, their lives, and occupations; the death of her mother; her father's\n              work as a minister; and her responsibility for her six younger brothers. She discusses\n              attending the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina in order to become\n              a teacher; desiring to work as a teacher in Africa; and having to leave teaching\n              because she became ill. She recalls her seven year engagement to a man she met in\n              college; his refusal to marry before he completed his degree; and his death before\n              their wedding."

She discusses moving to\n              Brooklyn after her time in Mount Vernon; attending a Quaker seminary; and teaching\n              religious education at different churches five nights a week for seven years. She\n              recalls her social life, including associating herself with mostly young professionals\n              in New York; marrying because she was getting older; and not having a happy marriage\n              because she realized her husband had married her for her money and property. She\n              discusses owning a boardinghouse for young working women; helping these women to\n              support themselves; allowing the women to stay for one month free of charge and then\n              charging them minimal amounts until they could afford their own room elsewhere; and\n              deciding to create the house because she would have wanted help if she was in the same\n              situation."

The main topics include Beatrice Joseph's\n              work in the garment industry; her living arrangement with her mother; and her\n              marriage. Joseph discusses living on 62nd street in Manhattan, New York with her\n              mother from the time they immigrated to the United States (US) until Joseph married,\n              and giving her mother all of her wages. She recalls taking the N train in the New York\n              City subway to the Garment District neighborhood of Manhattan in order to look for\n              work; sewing buttons by hand in a garment factory; and never feeling that she was\n              denied work because of her race. She discusses her husband, including the fact that\n              they met at his uncle's church; her confusion regarding his place of birth in the\n              Caribbean; his work in the garment industry; their two children, both of whom died in\n              infancy; and his death in 1953."

The main topics of this interview include Joseph Katz's childhood in\n              Lithuania, his work in the garment industry, his education in the United States (US),\n              and his union involvement. Katz begins by discussing his early life in Lithuania,\n              including having two brothers who became Hebrew teachers; living in a two room house\n              which doubled as a small grocery store; and immigrating to the US in order to avoid\n              the draft in Lithuania. He describes his life after immigration, including arriving in\n              Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but immediately moving to Baltimore, Maryland to stay with\n              a family friend; attending night school in Baltimore to learn English; training to be\n              a cutter in the garment industry and being paid five dollars a week; joining the\n              Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union (ACWA) Local 15 in Baltimore; and moving\n              to New York City in order to find work when his Local went on strike. Katz discusses\n              his employment after migrating to New York, including transferring to the ACWA Local\n              4; being paid double what he received in Baltimore; attending an unspecified design\n              school at night; and working seasonally. He discusses his union involvement in detail,\n              including his attendance at weekly meetings; his participation in votes regarding\n              strikes; the lack of strength of the union in regards to negotiation with businesses;\n              and the fact that the ACWA provided educational programs for its members."

This interview covers Jennie Krawitz's\n              childhood in Kiev; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1909; and her\n              involvement in the garment industry and the International Ladies' Garment Workers'\n              Union (ILGWU). Krawitz begins by describing her childhood in Kiev, recalling how she\n              learned to sew in school and that she and her sisters were orphaned prior to their\n              immigration to the US. She describes immigrating to the US in 1909; initially settling\n              with her cousins in New York, New York; and bringing her two sisters to the US. She\n              explains that she worked making ladies' waists. She recalls working at the Triangle\n              Shirtwaist Factory; her experience during the fire in 1911; her four month recovery in\n              the hospital; and being awarded an $800 settlement. She recounts transitioning from\n              week work to sample making to piece work, noting that she made enough money to\n              vacation in the mountains or in Florida during July and August. She explains that she\n              was an active member of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union; participated\n              in strikes in 1909 and 1911; taught her husband how to make dresses; and helped her\n              husband become a manager for Local 22 of the ILGWU. Other topics include reflections\n              on Italian women in the garment industry; her husband's other occupation as a writer;\n              and her reflections on the nursing home in which she lived at the time of the\n              interview."

The interview covers\n              Rose Kriemer's family and childhood in Russia, her immigration to the United States\n              (US), her working life, and her union activity. Kriemer discusses her family and\n              childhood in Russia, including her father's occupation as a teacher in Kiev and the\n              family's small farm. She describes working in the US after her immigration and wanting\n              to attend school, but being unable to do so as she was required to work overtime in\n              order to keep her job. She recounts returning to work in order to provide better\n              opportunities for her children. She describes the first factory in which she worked,\n              including the decent working conditions; her salary; one strike in which she\n              participated that brought in an unspecified fur workers' union (likely the\n              International Fur and Leather Workers Union of the United States and Canada); changes\n              in working conditions and salaries after the factory was unionized; and her return to\n              the factory after her children started school. She describes herself as a fast worker\n              and able to make a good living with piece work. She describes the abilities of the\n              other workers in relation to herself; the types of jobs in the factory; and the\n              division of labor between men and women. She discusses the system of work in the\n              factory; the fact that some workers brought work home in order to make more money\n              through the piece work system; and her decision to bring this to the notice of the\n              supervisors. She describes seasonal work, including working overtime from January to\n              April and working two or three days a week the rest of the year. She explains that\n              most problems in the factory existed between the workers since the unions taught the\n              members how to get along with management."

She attended school while occasionally\n              working in the same textile factory as her parents and in domestic service. Her father\n              sent her and her siblings to Vienna, Austria so that they could avoid the hazards of\n              factory work. She immigrated to the United States in 1922. She lived in different\n              neighborhoods in New York, New York. She married a carpenter and had one daughter."

The interview covers Rose Lapidus'\n              early life in Russia and her working life. Lapidus discusses her early life in a small\n              town near Minsk, Russia, including antisemitism there and different jobs she held as a\n              child and young woman. She discusses her immigration to the United States (US). She\n              describes her first few jobs in garment factories in the US and the reasons she lost\n              them, attributing these losses to the fact that the factories were non-union. She\n              recounts working after her marriage and up until a few weeks before the birth of her\n              son. She discusses not working in one place for too long; finding jobs through friends\n              or agencies; preferring to be paid a salary rather than for piecework; and taking in\n              work at home while her son was young. She describes the physical conditions in union\n              and non-union factories and the benefits to working in union factories. She describes\n              her work as a machine operator and the work of the finishers and pressers in the\n              garment factories."

The interview covers Catherine Leddie's early\n              life in Ireland, her immigration to the United States (US), her working life, and her\n              personal life. Leddie recalls Ireland as a beautiful place in which everyone had\n              plenty to eat, but that young people were eager to leave as there was no opportunity\n              for them there. She recalls enjoying the voyage to the US with neighbors and friends\n              and knowing what to expect in New York, New York from listening to other immigrants\n              who returned to Ireland recount their experiences. Her memories of her working life in\n              New York include searching advertisements for housework, as that was the only work\n              available to Irish women. She describes her first job living and working in the house\n              of Henry Siegel in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan; being happy to work\n              for the family; and enjoying their displays of wealth, especially their horses,\n              carriages, and large household staff. She discusses how, as she gained more\n              experience, she was able to acquire better paying positions. "

Main topics include\n              Kelson Lee's work as a milliner; his life in New York, New York from the Prohibition\n              era through World War II; and social activities in which he participated. Lee touches\n              on his early life, including being the oldest of six children; having one sister who\n              was a doctor; and his family spreading out around the United States while he stayed in\n              New York. He discusses his work as a milliner, including starting by selling flowers\n              to hat manufacturers before owning his own company manufacturing ladies' hats. He\n              recalls his hiring practices, including the fact that most of his workers were women;\n              that he would not hire immigrants, in particular German Jews; and that he and his\n              employees were members of the United Hatters of North America. He explains that his\n              company survived the Great Depression because women did not stop wearing hats during\n              the period. He comments on his social activities, including frequenting speakeasies,\n              nightclubs, and cafes; and reading the ,\n                , and . He also discusses his wife, including meeting her at a\n              restaurant that he and his friends went to regularly; attending many social activities\n              and events with her; never fighting in their 40 years of marriage; and missing her\n              tremendously after she died.",

He recalls his childhood, including living in different areas of Manhattan;\n              attending both Catholic and public elementary schools; and living in a predominantly\n              German and Irish community. He discusses his employment history, including working for\n              the Siegel-Cooper department store in Manhattan as a messenger during school\n              vacations; working for Jacob Ruppert \u0026 Company brewery in the Yorkville\n              neighborhood of Manhattan; and being employed in an unspecified war production factory\n              during World War II. He discusses working in construction for most of his life and his\n              wife supplementing his income by working from home as a seamstress. He recalls his\n              military service during WWI, including being drafted into the Army; being sent to Camp\n              Upton on Long Island for training; and being stationed at Camp Upton for a short time\n              before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Other topics regarding WWI\n              include the increased beer tax preventing Leonard from frequenting bars for lunch; his\n              neighbors not supporting the United States' (US) involvement in the war until the\n              sinking of the ; and that after the war\n              there were no jobs.

He discusses politics in the US, including the\n              increased support for the Nazi Party in his neighborhood because the German population\n              believed Adolf Hitler was good for Germany; his opinion that state politicians focused\n              on winning the votes of New York City residents because the population was large\n              enough to determine election results; his belief that the Socialist Party of America\n              was good for workers but that it lost influence after WWI; and that he did not view\n              McCarthyism as a problem since it did not directly affect him or his neighbors."

The interview covers Samuel Levine's childhood in Brestowitz,\n              Poland; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1913; and his work in the garment\n              and service industries and as a peddler. Levine describes his childhood in Poland,\n              recalling the various garment factories in which he worked from the age of 13. He\n              notes that he decided to immigrate to the US in order to avoid conscription into the\n              Russian Army. He explains that he first lived with his uncle in Portchester, New York\n              before moving to Cherry Street in Manhattan. He emphasizes the strong relationship\n              between himself and his wife's family that developed over the years in which he\n              boarded with them and after his marriage in 1916. He describes working as a milliner,\n              peddler, waiter, and cloakman, noting that although he initially made less money in\n              the US than he did in Poland, the work in the US was easier. Other topics include his\n              education at night classes in New York; his wife's occupation as a trimmer; his\n              enjoyment of the movies and Jewish theater; his US citizenship; and his children's\n              education."

The interview\n              covers Sylvia Levine's childhood in Minsk, Russia; her work in garment factories in\n              New York, New York; and her husband's life. She discusses her childhood in Minsk,\n              including learning Yiddish and Russian from a tutor in her home and attending Hebrew\n              school. She discusses her work in the US, including the different types of ladies'\n              garments she produced and production at the separate factories for each garment. She\n              describes her first job as a member of an unspecified union (likely the International\n              Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and struggles with her supervisor over pricing of the\n              garments. She states that she had to stop working in 1918 when she married, but that\n              she was able to return to work in 1931. Topics from her husband's life include his\n              emigration from Russia; his travels across the US in search of work; his jobs as a\n              machinist in Detroit, Michigan and Cleveland, Ohio; his work at the Wright-Martin\n              Aircraft Corporation in New Jersey; and his political opinions."

Levinson discusses his\n              difficulty emigrating from the Soviet Union, including leaving his mother and sister\n              behind to walk to the border of the Soviet Union and Poland; having to bribe Bolshevik\n              border guards with his mother's watch; sending for his mother and sister after he\n              arrived in Poland; and his mother being shot by the Bolshevik guards. He recalls his\n              family being arrested in Poland for being in the country illegally; receiving valid\n              passports with the help of the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society of America;\n              and the anti-Semitism the family encountered in Poland. He recalls his early\n              experiences in the United States (US) including working in a dry goods store; quitting\n              his job in order to attend a private school; his father having a stroke, leaving\n              Levinson the sole earner of the household; and finding a job in the knitting\n              industry."

He recalls being elected to a provisional committee\n              at his first ILGWU meeting and increasing the number of knitting workers in attendance\n              by asking everyone to bring a new attendee to each meeting.

This interview covers George Lewis's\n              childhood in Alabama; his migrations to Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New York; and his\n              life and work at each of these locations. Lewis begins by discussing a lack of\n              education in the United States (US), noting that many schools excluded black children\n              and poor children. He recalls having a doctor create a fake birth certificate and a\n              friend teach him the appropriate technical knowledge so that he could work on the\n              railroad. He describes a series of migrations after he left the railroad, noting that\n              he went from the southern US to the northern US and back again before realizing that\n              he could no longer tolerate the racism in his hometown and leaving for good in 1920.\n              Lewis describes migrating to New York, New York in 1922, recalling that he did not\n              have any family in New York and that he had to pursue different lines of work because\n              employers were wary of hiring black employees in the mechanical fields. Other topics\n              include descriptions of his jobs and wages; the impact of segregation on the various\n              places in which he lived and traveled; his leisure activities in New York; anecdotes\n              about how he developed his skills; his recollections concerning labor unions; and his\n              experiences with politics and religion."

Main topics of discussion include Lewis'\n              life in Trinidad and Tobago; his social life in New York City between the 1930s and\n              the time of the interview; and politics at the time of the interview. Lewis discusses\n              his early life in Trinidad and Tobago, including his family being wealthy and his\n              father owning three estates; his father dying when Lewis was six; having three sisters\n              and one brother; and attending high school. He mentions his immigration to the United\n              States, including his first impressions of New York City; immigrating in order to\n              continue his education; living with his aunt in Manhattan until he married in 1927;\n              attending night school to become an auto mechanic; and being in awe of the New York\n              City Subway and elevators. He discusses his participation in the social scene and\n              leisure activities in New York City, including attending the Cotton Club every\n              Thursday; socializing with his neighbors on the street and in cafes. He also recalls\n              the existence of a large West Indian community in both Brooklyn and Harlem. He lists\n              former employers, including Eastern Foundry in Trinidad and Tobago; and in the US,\n              working for an unnamed spring manufacturer; Bethlehem Steel Corporation; and Wilson\n              Slaughterhouse in Manhattan, New York. He discusses working as an elevator operator\n              until his retirement. Lewis mentions that he was a member of an unnamed elevator\n              operators' union and that the strikes were never violent. He discusses politics at the\n              time of the interview including feeling disillusioned with politics; supporting Adam\n              Clayton Powell, Jr. and thinking Powell was killed because of his influence in the\n              community; and believing that the events of the Watergate Scandal were not uncommon\n              within politics."

Loskowitz compares his life in Russia with\n              his life in US, including his surprise at the differences in the family's living\n              arrangements; his confusion over laundry hanging outdoors on clotheslines; and his\n              experiences at school. He discusses his work at the Canadian Car and Foundry Company's\n              munitions plant in New Jersey; the explosion at the plant in 1917; and his\n              recuperation at a stranger's home.

The audio recording for this interview is missing. This interview covers\n              Gwendaline Lynch's childhood and early adult life in Jamaica and Colombia; her\n              immigration to the United States (US) in 1921; and her work for and relationship with\n              Marcus Garvey. Lynch describes her childhood and education in Jamaica. She discusses\n              her immigration to Colombia after graduating from St. John's College and Preparatory\n              School and her decision to live near her step-sister and her husband. She describes\n              her work as a secretary for a prestigious banker and how his competitors tried to\n              poach her while he was away. She explains that she did not encounter racial prejudice\n              in Colombia, but that there were distinctions along gender and class lines and that\n              she was viewed as different because it was not customary for women to work. She\n              explains that she returned to Jamaica when she contracted malaria and from there\n              immigrated to the United States (US) in 1921, originally intending to stay only six\n              months."

She explains that she first met Marcus Garvey in Jamaica and that she became\n              his secretary and stenographer in New York after attending one of his meetings there.\n              She describes Garvey's ideology and philosophy; the problems with developing and\n              implementing the Black Star Line, particularly the first voyage of the Yarmouth;\n              tension between Garvey's idealist views and the mercenary tendencies of those that\n              worked for him; his relationship with W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington; and his\n              arrest for mail fraud, trial, and subsequent time in jail. She explains that she left\n              Garvey's organization before she married in 1925. She discusses her career after her\n              marriage, including working for a broker in Harlem, for a dress business, and for the\n              federal government during World War II. Other topics include teaching English to\n              children in Colombia; political disputes and the impact they had on the Colombian\n              people; a secretarial business she established with some friends in New York; her\n              children's education and occupations; and a comparison of the situation of the black\n              population in the US in the past and at the time of the interview."

She\n              recalls that she would have remained in Puerto Rico but that her mother sent her,\n              despite her desire to stay, and that this created a rift between them. She explains\n              that the rest of her family eventually migrated to New York in search of economic\n              security. She recounts attending high school at night in New York and notes that few\n              of the Puerto Rican students took their education seriously.

The interview covers Magliacano's early life in\n              Salerno, Italy; his immigration to the United States (US); his varied career in the\n              American labor movement; and his personal life. Magliacano discusses his childhood in\n              San Marco in the province of Salerno; his family; and his immigration to the US. He\n              discusses working as a barber in New York City; being a member of an unspecified\n              barbers' union; attending an unspecified school in Manhattan (likely the Rand School\n              of Social Science); and attending and graduating from an unspecified chiropractic\n              college in Manhattan (likely the Carver Chiropractic College) He discusses hitchhiking\n              to Chicago, Illinois after graduation to attend a postgraduate course at an\n              unspecified chiropractic college there; learning that the barbers' union was holding\n              its national convention in Indianapolis, Indiana and deciding to attend; and deciding\n              to rejoin the labor movement while at the convention. He discusses joining the Italian\n              American anti-Fascist movement in New York and this decision leading to his becoming\n              an organizer for different labor unions, including the United Textile Workers of\n              America (UTW) and the United Shoe Workers' Union (USWU). He discusses his work as an\n              organizer; his involvement as a representative of the UTW in the textile workers'\n              strike in Passaic, New Jersey in 1926; his work with an unspecified relief\n              organization aiding striking coal miners in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky\n              in 1928 and 1929; and his work for the USWU between 1929 and 1932. Other topics\n              include Magliacano's opinion of the Catholic Church; his travel to the Soviet Union in\n              the late 1960s and early 1970s as a member of a trade union delegation; a visit to San\n              Marco in 1961 and the changes there since his childhood; and his life at the time of\n              the interview."

She\n              discusses her first job in a garment factory; her efforts to educate the workers as to\n              their rights; the foreman's attempts to keep her away from the workers by moving her\n              to officework; and her decision to leave this job. She explains that she worked for a\n              time as a social worker, including at the Immigrant Aid Society and then the Hebrew\n              Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society (HSIAS). She recounts moving into the position of\n              social worker at HSIAS after the death of the previous social worker, despite having\n              little experience.

This interview covers Mrs. Manar's life\n              in Puerto Rico; her migration to the United States (US) in 1945; and her acclimation\n              to life in the US. She describes dreaming about living in the US, noting the freedom\n              of speech and greater economic opportunity as her main reasons for wanting to migrate.\n              She explains that her husband had been a teacher in Puerto Rico but worked as a clerk\n              at the Metropolitan Hospital in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York\n              after their migration. She recounts her family's Americanization, noting that although\n              they retained some of the culinary traditions of Puerto Rico, they changed the\n              majority of their customs, in particular their language. She explains that the\n              neighborhoods surrounding both 110th Street and 103rd Street were bad, recalling gang\n              and drug activity, but notes that neither of these issues prevented her children from\n              thriving. She describes city funded programs and Catholic charities that would take\n              the children on trips and leisure activities at beaches, parks, and the movies. She\n              recounts instances of discrimination against her and her children and the\n              relationships among different ethnic groups in the neighborhoods in which she\n              lived."

The interview covers Mansberg's early life in Galicia,\n              Austria-Hungary; her separation from her family during World War I; her life in Europe\n              after the war; her immigration to the United States (US); and her life in New York\n              City up to the 1930s. Topics from her early life include her family's poverty; her\n              difficult relationship with her stepmother; her affection for her father and her\n              sorrow when he was unable to earn enough wages to support the family; and her\n              education. Mansberg's memories of World War I include fleeing from Cossacks with her\n              family; running away on her own to present-day Czechoslovakia, where she worked on a\n              farm; and her reunion with her family after the war. She recounts meeting her future\n              husband, Morris Mansberg, and moving with him to Budapest; learning about communism;\n              and her decision to emigrate from Austria-Hungary in 1921 after Miklós Horthy came to\n              power.

She discusses her\n              working life, including working with other Jewish women, mainly Hungarians and Poles;\n              moving to different parts of the city and commuting to Manhattan for work; returning\n              to work after the birth of each of her children; and striking for better working\n              conditions at different union and non-union shops.

The interview covers Fannie Marin's early\n              life in Poland; her two marriages and the birth of her son; and her working life in\n              the United States (US). She discusses her immigration to the US in 1906 and having to\n              leave her son in Poland with her in-laws until she was able to send for him in 1910.\n              She discusses her first jobs in the US, including sewing ribbons on pajamas in a\n              factory and working as a practical nurse in a doctor's office. She discusses her\n              second husband, who was a painter and a member of an unspecified painters' union\n              (possibly the Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators, and Paperhangers of America), and\n              his death in 1923 due to lead poisoning. She discusses her job as a fur finisher in\n              her brother-in-law's shop and the different ethnic groups in the shop. She discusses\n              her membership in an unspecified fur workers' union (likely the International Fur\n              Workers Union of the United States and Canada) and political struggles within the\n              union, particularly between supporters of Benjamin Gold and supporters of Morris\n              Kaufman."

This interview covers Giuseppe Massa's childhood; his work experience;\n              his union involvement; and his leisure activities in New York, New York. Massa recalls\n              a rough upbringing in Italy, including making less than 50 Lire in a good week; being\n              punished physically by his mother if he didn't behave; gaining longshoreman experience\n              working on a boat; and coming to the United States in order to have a better life. He\n              discussed injuries he sustained while working as a longshoreman, including falling\n              down a flight of stairs and injuring his back, and receiving $600 in compensation for\n              the loss of part of his finger. He briefly mentions his involvement with the\n              International Longshoremen's Association Local 1814, in particular reluctantly\n              participating in strikes, and wishing the union would help him in his old age,\n              particularly with his medical bills.

This interview covers Joseph Marino's childhood in Italy; his\n              immigration to the United States (US); and work in the garment industry in New York,\n              New York. Marino begins by describing his childhood in Italy, noting that his father\n              immigrated to the US when Marino was young in order to support his family. He recalls\n              wanting to come to the US as soon as he was able and and settling on Mott Street in\n              the Little Italy neighborhood of Manhattan with his father and brother. He notes his\n              initial amazement at the size of New York City upon his arrival. He explains that he\n              started working as a barber but did not like it, so he apprenticed himself at his\n              brother's tailor shop. Marino describes working for no pay for three and a half years\n              while he learned the trade; having a dispute with both his manager and his brother\n              over his meager wages when he did receive a salary; leaving his brother's shop and\n              opening his own tailor shop; and closing his business and working for other custom\n              tailor shops. He recalls joining the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Local\n              162, emphasizing the union's involvement in limiting work hours and improving wages.\n              Other topics include his views on Catholicism; his daughter; his views on Richard\n              Nixon and the Watergate scandal; a comparison of his hometown in Italy in the past and\n              at the time of the interview; and his views on and activities in the community center\n              he frequented at the time of the interview."

The interview covers her family and her occupation as a\n              dancer at the Cotton Club. McAuley discusses her family, including the fact that her\n              parents were married despite her father being white and her mother black, and explains\n              that this was common practice in port towns in the southern United States (US). She\n              explains that people in the southern US accepted segregation as a fact of life. She\n              describes meeting her first husband in college; running away from home to marry him in\n              1919; and living near Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, New York. She discusses becoming a\n              dancer while escorting her daughter's dance troupe across the US and becoming a dancer\n              at the Cotton Club in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan when her daughter entered\n              kindergarten. She recounts her time at the Cotton Club, including feeding people in\n              bread lines during the Great Depression with other performers; the segregation between\n              the performers, who were black, and the audience members, who were white; and the code\n              of conduct amongst the performers. She discusses living with her daughter in England\n              and France for three years while performing with a Cotton Club revue and hiring a\n              private tutor for her daughter while in Europe.

Meeks\n              discusses his family and his childhood in the Carolinas, including his two brothers;\n              his grandparents, who were born enslaved; and the professions of many of his family\n              members, including his mother's employment as a practical nurse and his father's\n              employment in public works. He recalls that the family was considered middle class;\n              that his family attended church in Charlotte, North Carolina; an outbreak of smallpox\n              in 1905, and other epidemics in North Carolina; and his participation in social\n              activities such as church picnics. He recollects his motivations for migrating to New\n              York City, including the scarcity of work during the Great Depression; one of his\n              aunts telling him that New York City was the best place to go for a better living; and\n              his inability to find work as a subcontractor because he was not a member of a union.\n              Meeks discusses the ways in which World War II (WWII) impacted his life, including\n              using ration books; believing that the United States (US) government stole his car\n              tires; being asked to donate aluminum pots and pans to the war effort; and not having\n              a fear of Adolph Hitler attempting to attack the US.

Topics in this interview include Danny Meyers' family, his experience\n              driving a taxi, and the process of unionizing taxi drivers. Meyers discusses his\n              family, including the fact that his father died when Meyers was seven; the fact that\n              his family was very religious; and the fact that his family would have prefered that\n              he had chosen a different profession. He discusses the fact that his children\n              continued to practice their Jewish faith as adults and the fact that he felt proud\n              that all of his children had graduated from college. He recollects his career driving\n              a taxi, including starting during the Great Depression so that he would not have to\n              ask for government assistance; being robbed and assaulted many times during his\n              career; and playing cards with the other taxi drivers after a shift. Meyers recounts\n              driving Fiorello La Guardia to a meeting at 3:00 in the morning and how this\n              interaction led to La Guardia being the only politician that Meyers ever supported.\n              Meyers discusses in detail multiple attempts at unionization of taxi drivers; the\n              support given by John L. Lewis, Mike Quill, and Jimmy Hoffa; the effects of these\n              attempts; and his speculation as to why they were unsuccessful until 1966. He\n              elaborates on the benefits of unionization, including no longer needing to bribe the\n              dispatcher in order to get a vehicle for the day; gaining larger commissions on each\n              fare; creating solidarity within the taxi driving community; and believing that\n              unionization was greatly beneficial to taxi drivers."

The main topics of this interview\n              include Miller's early life in Dobromil in Austrian Galicia; his work in the garment\n              industry in the United States; and his involvement in the International Ladies'\n              Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 9, the Workmen's Circle, and the Socialist Party\n              of America. Miller discusses his early life in Dobromil, including his mother working\n              as a seamstress in order to support the family; her requiring him to attend school\n              even though the family was poor; and not completing apprenticeship as a tailor. He\n              recalls his early work in the garment industry, including getting his first job\n              through his brother-in-law; beginning as a non-union employee because he did not have\n              enough experience or training; refusing to work on Saturdays; having to borrow money\n              from his brother-in-law to buy his first union dues book; and looking for new work\n              consistently, due to the seasonal nature of the garment industry.

He discusses his\n              election to multiple positions within the union, including assistant manager of the\n              ILGWU Local 9; the manager of the Organizational Department; and a member of the\n              Out-of-Town Department. He recalls the types of work he did within each position,\n              including attempting to organize non-union shops; working with shop owners to keep\n              union members employed; acting as a liaison between shop owners and union members; and\n              passing all of his decisions in front of a union board so that no one could accuse him\n              of corruption. He discusses his involvement with the Socialist Party of America,\n              including joining in 1914 in order to learn more about the movement; leaving the party\n              when the Communist movement gained momentum, though still supporting Socialist ideals;\n              and re-joining the party around 1940. He briefly recounts his involvement with the\n              Workmen's Circle in Manhattan, including being pushed to run for office; being\n              minimally active due to time constraints with his work at the ILGWU; and appreciating\n              that he was provided with excellent medical care throughout his membership."

She\n              explains that she loves the United States (US) to the point where she would erase her\n              Russian heritage if she could, recalling the often violent discrimination against Jews\n              in Russia, and how this prompted her sister's immigration to the US. She describes her\n              immigration to the United States in 1912 and her work with her sister to earn enough\n              money to send for their mother in 1914. She recalls that her aunt helped her get her\n              first job as a seamstress on Manhattan Avenue in New York City, noting that she was\n              instructed to hide in the bathroom whenever a customer entered the shop because she\n              looked too young to be working. She recalls her membership in the International\n              Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 25; the organization of local garment\n              shops; and strikes for better wages, which were often defeated by strikebreakers\n              brought in by the employers. She describes having an especially strong bond with\n              Italian immigrants due to their shared immigrant experience and their work together\n              membership in the ILGWU. She recalls Communists attempting to infiltrate and disrupt\n              the ILGWU by discussing irrelevant topics at meetings and fainting during\n              organizational events."

He recounts Communists taking his father's\n              inheritance and this prompting his family's immigration to the US in search of better\n              economic and educational opportunities. He recalls his family wanting him to become a\n              shochet, a person trained to slaughter animals according to Jewish law, but studying\n              electrical engineering through the International Correspondence School instead. He\n              explains that General Electric would not hire him due to his Jewish heritage and so he\n              sought work in the garment industry. He recounts moving to Greenville, South Carolina\n              at the behest of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) in order to\n              augment the development of the garment industry and the ACWA's presence in the\n              southern US; sending his paychecks back to his family in New York; and visiting his\n              family every two or three months. He endeavors to explain his love of the southern US\n              by describing the environment and the people, emphasizing his belief that\n              African-Americans in the south were very educated. Molly Newman frequently interjects\n              with her disdain for the southern United States. "

This interview covers Rose Elizabeth (Bessie) O'Banyan's childhood in\n              Littleton, Massachusetts; her moves to Boston, Massachusetts and New York, New York;\n              and her work as a domestic worker, a laborer in an arms factory, and a musician.\n              O'Banyan begins the interview by recalling her childhood in Littleton, Massachusetts,\n              noting that her family emigrated from Canada in order to be closer to their relatives.\n              She emphasizes the role her mother had in her life, noting that her self-discipline,\n              work ethic, honesty, and dedication to religion all came from her mother's rules and\n              love for her children. She discusses her family's involvement in a local Unitarian\n              church; the various fruit-picking jobs she and her siblings performed in the summer\n              and fall; a trip to visit her family in Sheldon, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia;\n              her family's experience during World War I; and her experience with racial\n              discrimination in both the northern and southern United States.

She explains that a friend wrote to her brother\n              in New York and begged him to help his sister during the turbulent aftermath. She\n              recalls moving to New York on April 30, 1931, where she worked as a domestic worker\n              and as a laborer in an arms factory during World War II. She recounts lining up at\n              167th Street and Jerome Avenue in the Bronx for daywork and the fact that women often\n              undercut one another by offering to work for less. She recalls spending most of the\n              years after her heart attack in 1949 playing the organ and piano for various churches,\n              especially after a religious experience she had in the 1960s drew her back to her\n              dedication to Christianity. Other topics include some history and genealogy of her\n              family; her views on God and religion; the differences between life in the countryside\n              and life in the city; and her work as a musician at senior citizen centers at the time\n              of the interview."

This interview covers Isidore Opochinsky's\n              life in Hungary; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1921; his work as a fur\n              machine operator in New York, New York; and his union activity. Opochinsky tends to\n              mumble and is sometimes hard to understand. He provides few details about his\n              childhood and early life in Europe, focusing on his involvement in the General Jewish\n              Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia. He recalls that he learned of the\n              importance of unionization and the tenets of Socialism through members of the Bund. He\n              notes that members of the Bund who immigrated to the US had an easier time acclimating\n              because they had the resources and social ties of an organized group. He explains that\n              he worked without pay for six months while he trained in the fur industry in Europe.\n              He recounts immigrating to the US in 1921, because he could not make a living in\n              Europe after World War I, and settling with his brother in New York, New York. He\n              explains that he returned to Europe after a conflict with an unspecified fur workers'\n              union (likely the International Fur and Leather Workers Union). He discusses his\n              return to the United States when he could not find work in Europe and his vow to rid\n              the union of those in power who monopolized its funds and activities. He recalls\n              neglecting his education and his family in order to reorganize the leadership of the\n              union, noting that after his removal of the corrupt leaders, the resulting chaos\n              provided an opportunity for the Communists gain power. He describes a strike that\n              occurred in 1926, including the fact that it lasted 26 weeks; that the police killed\n              many of the strikers; and that the strikers won, earning medical benefits and better\n              hours and wages. Other topics include details of the work of the fur industry; a\n              comparison of labor unions and living and working conditions in Europe and the US; and\n              his attendance and involvement in an unspecified conference concerned with Jewish\n              labor issues in Geneva, Switzerland."

In addition to Frank Pane, there is an unknown man who\n              intermittently comments on the interviewers' questions. This interview covers Pane's\n              childhood in Italy, his immigration to the United States, and his life and work as a\n              bookbinder and longshoreman in New York, New York. Pane discusses his family history,\n              noting the contrast between his father, who was a relatively poor longshoreman, and\n              his mother, who had inherited two large homes from her parents. He recounts how his\n              father's schooner was destroyed by a steamboat while at sea and how the steamboat\n              crew, who were headed to the United States, brought him with them, and he settled in\n              New York in order to acquire more job opportunities. Pane and the rest of his family\n              immigrated to the United States later in 1898 via the ship Victoria. He describes the\n              poor living conditions that many immigrants, including his family, endured. He notes\n              that during the the depressions before and after World War I, Father Vogel at the\n              Saint Charles Chapel on Van Brunt and President Streets in Brooklyn, New York would\n              distribute food and coal tickets to poor families. He describes evading the draft\n              during World War II in order to support his family and shifting his occupation from\n              bookbinder to work as a caulker in the shipyards. He notes that he liked the work due\n              to the outdoor environment, a stark contrast to the dirty factories that he had worked\n              in as a bookbinder, but disliked the inconsistent employment. Pane emphasizes the\n              politics of New York City, specifically the relationship between Democratic and\n              Republican policies during the Great Depression. He ascribes the depressions of the\n              early 20th century to the Republican administrations."

This interview covers Becky Prescant's childhood in Poland; her immigration\n              to the United States (US) in 1912; and her work and union activity in the garment\n              industry in New York, New York. Prescant describes her hometown in Poland, noting that\n              although there was no open hostility between the Jewish people and other religious\n              populations, the local school did not accept Jewish students. She recalls learning\n              Hebrew at a Jewish school; learning how to sew at a local tailor shop; and working on\n              the family farm. She explains that she chose to immigrate to the US because there were\n              no Jewish men for her to marry and no doctors in her town. She mentions that some of\n              her other siblings emigrated in order to avoid being drafted into the Russian Army or\n              being persecuted for their belief in Socialism. "

Preuhs begins by describing his\n              father's work in a bakery in Hamburg, Germany, noting his membership in a local union\n              and his progression from employee to manager of his own business. He describes working\n              as an apprentice for three years before traveling to various German cities during his\n              time as a journeyman. Preuhs explains that he joined the German merchant marine in\n              order to travel and was subsequently drafted into the German Navy in 1906, serving on\n              a warship stationed in Hamburg. Upon his discharge from the Navy, he acquired a\n              position on a merchant ship and illegally jumped ship in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1911.\n              He describes settling in the Beggars' Boarding House on 5th Street between 1st and 2nd\n              Avenue in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, noting the ease with\n              which he found work due to the myriad of small German bakeries in the city. He\n              explains that he worked in many of these bakeries in different parts of the city and\n              moved often in order to live near or in his current workplace. Other topics from his\n              life in the US include the seasonal nature of the baking industry; his time working in\n              Chicago, Illinois; and the development of technology in the baking industry and its\n              role in the obsolescence of many physical laborers."

His mother worked in a kitchen for the city\n              of Hamburg during an unspecified war but otherwise did not work outside the home. He\n              attended school in Germany for eight years before moving into the workforce as a baker\n              when he was 18 years old, joining a bakers' union in Hamburg. Preuhs served in the\n              German merchant marine and the German Navy before he immigrated to the United States\n              (US) in January 1911. He lived in the Beggars' Boarding House on 5th Street between\n              1st and 2nd Avenue in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York before\n              getting his own apartment. He worked as a baker and joined an unspecified bakers'\n              union in New York (likely the Journeymen Bakers Union of New York)."

She recounts joining\n              an unspecified laundry workers' union but notes that they didn't strike, and\n              conditions improved after the business was sold. She also describes her husband,\n              including the fact that he rarely worked; his dependence on her income and pension;\n              and their separation when she tired of his idleness and gambling.

Throughout the interview, Raia speaks in both Italian and English.\n              Topics of discussion include Raia's family, his emigration from Sicily, Italy, his\n              relationship with his wife and children, his work in the United States (US), and his\n              union involvement. Raia discusses his immigration to the US, including his\n              grandparents immigrating prior to his immigration; sending for his siblings to join\n              him after the death of their father in 1920; and leaving Sicily for economic and\n              social reasons. He recalls meeting his wife after one of her singing performances;\n              having three children with her; feeling proud of his children's accomplishments;\n              believing that men and women need to be treated as equals; and training his wife as a\n              machine operator in a dress factory. He recalls different jobs he held, including work\n              at a piano factory; on submarines in the Brooklyn Navy Yard; for the American Can\n              Company; in shoe manufacturing; and as a part-time actor. He discusses his union\n              involvement, including being a member of the Boot and Shoe Workers Union and an\n              unspecified millinery union; serving on the executive board of the Boot and Shoe\n              Workers Union; being involved in multiple strikes; and being called a Communist\n              because of his involvement with unions."

                                        "Text": "This interview was conducted by Jay Facciolo on December 12 and December 18, 1975 at\n              Edward Reid's home in Manhattan, New York. This interview covers Reid's childhood in\n              Jamaica; his immigration to the United States (US); and work as a carpenter in\n              Charleston, South Carolina and New York, New York. Reid begins by describing his\n              childhood in Jamaica, noting that his grandfather owned a blacksmithery and a farm\n              that was relatively self-sufficient, growing produce and raising livestock for the\n              family. Reid describes his time at Mt. Zion School, noting his position as a teacher's\n              aide once he reached the upper levels of elementary school and the fact that his\n              mother wanted him to become a teacher, an occupation he had little interest in\n              pursuing. He discusses the history and genealogy of parts of his family and race\n              relations in Jamaica. He explains that when he was 16 years old, he became an\n              apprentice to carpenters employed by his cousin, noting that he learned general\n              carpentry and built houses and factories in Jamaica. Reid explains that he immigrated\n              to the US in 1919 and acclimated to the United States in Charleston, South Carolina\n              with a different cousin because of the warm weather there. He describes encountering\n              segregation in the southern United States, noting that he ignored these restrictions\n              with few repercussions. He describes working for the Standard Oil Company and recalls\n              the racial segregation of the workforce. He recounts joining Local 52 of an\n              unspecified carpenters' union in Charleston; its two locals organized by race; and the\n              specific territories marked for where each local's members were allowed to work. Reid\n              provides an extended description of his job with the Consolidated Gas Company in\n              Charleston, noting the details of his work and his relationship with the foreman. He\n              discusses his work at an unspecified company in New York owned by Philip Egensky.\n              Other topics include his involvement with a church in Jamaica; his leisure activities;\n              a comparison between race relations in the northern and southern United States; and\n              his participation in cricket leagues in both Jamaica and the US."

The interview covers Evadni Richards' early life in Jamaica, her immigration to\n              the United States (US), her work in the garment industry, and her union activity.\n              Richards discusses her early life in Jamaica, including her education at a dressmaking\n              school in Kingston and her decision to immigrate to Cuba with a friend. She discusses\n              working as a domestic worker and companion in Cuba before immigrating to the US in\n              1922. She discusses her brother's business as a shoemaker in the Harlem neighborhood\n              of Manhattan and his illness, which led to his return to Jamaica in 1924 and left her\n              alone in the US. She discusses her work in the garment industry, including her wages;\n              her work in the designing room doing handwork; and the other West Indians who worked\n              in the factory with her. She compares Jamaica and New York from her childhood and the\n              1920s, in particular that there was no segregation in schools or churches; the\n              influence of colonialism in the workplace; and that wages were better in New York,\n              despite still being relatively little. She discusses discrimination in the garment\n              industry; her opinion that all workers, regardless of race or ethnicity, faced a\n              certain amount of discrimination; and racial discrimination she faced in the garment\n              industry, in particular not being allowed to work as a designer despite her training.\n              She recounts being chosen to learn to operate a special sewing machine despite being\n              the only black worker in the factory.

She discusses cultural programs\n              organized by the ILGWU, in particular Fannia Cohn and her Know Your City program; an\n              orchestra and dance troupe organized by the union; the popularity of these programs\n              with the general public; her participation in the chorus; and the participation of the\n              chorus and orchestra in the 1939-1940 New York World's Fair.

The interview covers Fannie Rief's\n              childhood in Austria, her immigration to the United States (US), her working life, and\n              her family life. Rief recounts aspects of her early life in Austria, including brief\n              biographies of her siblings. She recounts not attending school as only boys were\n              formally educated and teaching herself to read and write Yiddish. She discusses\n              anti-Semitism, wondering why it exists, and her belief that Jews were treated better\n              in Austria than in Germany and Russia. She recounts immigrating alone to the US in\n              1907 and living with a family friend in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan,\n              New York. She describes working as a servant for a number of Jewish families in New\n              York City. She discusses her belief that although life in the US was hard, it was\n              better than her life in Europe and describes ways in which new immigrants helped each\n              other acclimate to life in the US. She discusses the decline in religious adherence in\n              US amongst Jewish immigrants. She recalls her husband's career as a machine operator\n              in a ladieswear shop and his activity in an unspecified union (likely the\n              International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union). She discusses her son's education, his\n              marriage, and his worry over her health and well-being."

This interview covers Robinson's childhood in British Guiana; her immigration\n              to the United States (US) in 1924; and her life and work in New York, New York.\n              Robinson begins by describing her childhood in Plaisance, British Guiana, recalling\n              how discipline and the desire to make something of herself were instilled in her\n              through her household chores, education, and corporal punishment. She describes the\n              racial demographics of her classmates as being mostly black but not feeling animosity\n              between the black and East Indian populations of British Guiana; and not experiencing\n              racial discrimination and prejudice until she lived in the US.

This interview\n              covers Dominick Rocco's childhood in Procida, Italy; his illegal immigration to the\n              United States (US) in 1924; and his life and work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn, New\n              York. Rocco begins the interview by describing his childhood in Italy; his father's\n              cargo ship business; and the changes in Procida from when he left to the time of the\n              interview, noting an increase in educational opportunities and a decrease in the\n              number of people employed in labor-intensive jobs. He discusses being encouraged to\n              immigrate to the US after seeing the success of his father's workers who would go to\n              the US and return to Italy wealthier. He explains that his immigration in July 1924\n              impeded him from acquiring his citizenship until 1948. He recounts his settling on 2nd\n              Street in Brooklyn with his cousin's family and immediately working as a longshoreman.\n              He recalls joining the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) but notes that\n              its early incarnations were weak and indistinct due to its lack of communication and\n              organization, especially during the Great Depression. He discusses the fact that\n              longshoremen were predominantly Italian and notes that the large need for the\n              occupation dwindled over time and will perhaps completely disappear in the future. He\n              describes living in a predominantly Italian neighborhood in which there were many\n              large families of four to five children and that the older generations made sure to\n              pass the traditions of their homeland to the next generation. Other topics include his\n              marriage and subsequent move to 49th Street and Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn in 1929;\n              his first time taking the 7th Avenue subway in 1924; and his belief in building a\n              better life for himself in the US."

Alexander at the Kingsbridge Heights Nursing\n              Home in the Bronx, New York on an unspecified date. The audio recording for this\n              interview is missing. This interview covers Alfonso Rockwell's childhood in Virginia;\n              his migrations to Atlantic City, New Jersey and New York, New York; and his work and\n              leisure activities. Rockwell describes his hometown, noting his work on the family\n              farm and differences in the town between his childhood and the time of the interview.\n              He notes that there was a distinction between men's work and women's work, with men\n              fishing and women working on the farms or in tomato factories. He explains that he\n              left Virginia when he was 16 years old because he had heard that jobs and wages were\n              better in Atlantic City. He describes working in construction in Ocean City, New\n              Jersey; liking the lack of a union; marrying his first wife; and going to baseball\n              games, pool rooms, dances, and church during his free time. He discusses segregation\n              in his neighborhood; transitioning from construction work to cooking for job security;\n              and his preference for the Postal Savings System over banks. He describes moving to\n              New York; working odd jobs because of the lack of steady work; and returning to\n              Virginia when his grandmother became sick. Other topics include the relationship\n              between Baltimore, Maryland and his hometown; his time in the Army during World War\n              II; his political affiliation; and his religious beliefs."

She explains that she worked as a live-in domestic worker on 81st Street and\n              Madison Avenue on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, in the Bronx, and in\n              Pleasantville. Other topics include her passing the civil service examination; her\n              involvement with churches in Virginia and New York; and her son's experience in the\n              Army during World War II."

The interview covers both Rothman's life and that of\n              her brother, David Klein, who was also interviewed for the New York City Immigrant\n              Labor History Project. She discusses her early life in Hungary, including living with\n              an aunt and uncle in Hungary while the rest of her family returned to the United\n              States (US). She discusses her education, her parents' separation, and her aspiration\n              to become a psychiatrist. She recounts meeting her husband; moving to Budapest with\n              him after World War I; and deciding to emigrate once Béla Kun came to power. She\n              discusses her immigration to the US and her reunion with her family. She recounts\n              meeting her younger siblings and feeling shocked at the transformation of her family\n              from upper middle class intellectuals to people concerned only with the management of\n              the family shoe store. She discusses her rebellion against her eldest brother, Henry,\n              who controlled every aspect of the family, from how their business was run to how the\n              family would vote in political elections.

At first Lily Campanile, Rose Davy, Agnes\n              Mazza, and Giacomina Pasqua discuss their husbands' work as longshoremen and the ways\n              in which they would acquire jobs. They quickly start talking over one another and the\n              interviewers decide to speak to the women in smaller groups. Angelina Saltalamacchia\n              and Rose Davy are recorded together. The interview with Angelina Saltalamacchia\n              focuses on her husband's work as a longshoreman, but also covers his working life in\n              Italy and in the United States (US) before becoming a longshoreman; their immigration\n              to the US; her working life before their marriage; and their children. She discusses\n              her husband's career as a longshoreman in the US, including how hard he worked; his\n              salary; and the amount of compensation they received after he sustained a workplace\n              injury. She recounts the different jobs he held in the US before he became a\n              longshoreman, including working for an unspecified telephone company in New York City\n              and as a clerk in a store. She discusses her reasons for immigrating to the US and\n              other family members who immigrated before her. She describes different jobs she had\n              before her marriage; her work as a machine operator in garment factories; lists the\n              locations of the factories in New York City and what each produced; and the work she\n              did at each factory. She describes her unhappiness at her first job, due to not being\n              able to speak or understand English. She discusses her children, including their birth\n              dates; the death of one from leukemia; and the occupations of her surviving\n              children."

The location and date are unknown.\n              Main topics include Charles Saggese's immigration to the United States (US); his\n              employment; his marriage and family; his leisure activities; and his political and\n              religious views. Saggese discusses his immigration to the US at the age of 14; his\n              father's promise that he could return to Italy if he did not like the US; and his\n              belief that he would find gold in the streets in the US. He recalls his employment,\n              including becoming a barber at his wife's urging but having to close his barber shop\n              after he developed an allergy to the perfumes; working as a salesman for the\n              Metropolitan Life Insurance Company; and working as an elevator operator. He discusses\n              attempting to unionize the elevator workers in his building in 1936 and joining the\n              Building Service Employees International Union Local 32B. He discusses his marriage,\n              including asking his wife to refrain from working after they married because he\n              believed it was the husband's job to provide for his wife. Saggese discusses his\n              children, in particular his son's education as an engineer and his work on the\n              Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. He recalls leisure activities in which he participated,\n              including attending the opera and joining the St. Rosalie Club likely affiliated with\n              his parish, where he served as a secretary. He discusses his political views,\n              including being a registered Democrat and having a polling place in his barber shop.\n              He discusses his views on religion, including considering himself Catholic but not\n              attending church regularly and his belief that all religions were essentially the\n              same."

The interview covers Mary\n              Sansone's founding of and work at CIAO and stereotypes of Italian Americans. Sansone\n              discusses the perception that Italian Americans are family oriented and will support\n              each other through any difficulty; her work to reveal this perception as false; and\n              her founding of CIAO in order to provide a support network for Italian Americans. She\n              addresses the problem of Italian American students dropping out of high school and her\n              work to lower the dropout rate with different organizations including the Search for\n              Education, Elevation, and Knowledge Program (SEEK). She discusses the popularity of\n              the CIAO center in Brooklyn and their daycare and senior citizen programs."

This interview covers Joseph Savio's childhood in Italy, his\n              immigration to the United States (US) in 1901, and his life in New York, New York up\n              to the time of the interview. Savio briefly describes living in Italy, noting that\n              there was a severe economic divide between those who owned property and those who did\n              not. He discusses his family's immigration, with his parents and younger siblings\n              following the earlier immigration of his older siblings. He recounts the family\n              settling in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan; briefly attending school\n              on Solomon Street; struggling to learn English; working as a delivery boy; and being\n              apprenticed to a glove cutter. He discusses his work pressing and cutting the fingers\n              of gloves; perfecting his trade; becoming the foreman of the Steinberg Company for\n              several years; and opening his own business on East 28th Street. He describes the\n              working conditions of the glove factories as filthy, noting that he contracted a\n              disease from the fumes produced in processing the gloves. Other topics include Italian\n              immigrants' opinions on World War I and World War II; the shift in economic and living\n              conditions in the US during the wars; discrimination faced by Italians and Jews in the\n              areas he lived; and differences between New York City and his hometown."

This interview was\n              conducted in Italian with the aid of a translator who is often hard to hear. Topics\n              include Schiano's life in Italy, his family, work as a longshoreman, and leisure\n              activities. Schiano discusses his early life in Italy including having eight siblings;\n              marrying and having children; and working as a sailor. He remembers immigrating to the\n              United States (US) twice: once on his own and then again with his wife and children.\n              He discusses leisure activities in Brooklyn, New York, including trips to Prospect\n              Park, museums, and Coney Island; reading only Italian newspapers; and listening to\n              Italian music, but not Italian opera. He discusses feeling grateful for the\n              opportunities in the US and identifying as a Democrat. Other topics include being a\n              member of the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1814; finding employment\n              through friends; and working on the docks because he no longer wanted to go out to\n              sea. He speaks at length about his children, including how they spoke to him in\n              Italian while they spoke English amongst themselves; that he supported them until they\n              married so that they would have savings; and his insistence that they attend school\n              rather than work. He specifically describes feeling proud of his son for attending\n              college."

The audio recording\n              for this interview is missing. This interview covers Geraldo Scotto's childhood in\n              Italy; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1920; and his work as a\n              longshoreman in Brooklyn, New York. Scotto explains that he was the first member of\n              his family to immigrate to the US. He describes the work of longshoremen; working\n              conditions on the docks; the demographics of the longshoremen; and the development of\n              the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and its impact on longshoremen. He\n              explains that, although he moved three times while in the US, he always remained in\n              Brooklyn, specifically in Italian communities near many of his friends and family from\n              Italy. He notes that he did not speak English when he came to the US; that he learned\n              what he knows of the language from his wife, friends, and coworkers; and that he did\n              not experience any discrimination, though he did have trouble finding a job when he\n              first arrived in the US. Other topics include a trip he took to Italy in 1958; his\n              religious beliefs; his children's living and working situations at the time of the\n              interview; and his leisure activities."

The interview covers Ida Seltzer's\n              early life in Russia; her immigration to and early impressions of New York, New York;\n              her working life; and her marriage. Seltzer recounts her early life in a small town\n              near Minsk, Russia, including being a member of the Jewish community in a town\n              populated by both Jews and Christians and being taught to read and write Hebrew or\n              Yiddish by a tutor in her home. She describes her management of her household; her\n              care of her younger siblings after her mother died; and her difficult relationship\n              with her stepmother, which led to her immigration to the United States (US). Her\n              memories of life in New York City in the early 20th century include reacting to the\n              difference in fashions and hairstyles; eating ice cream for the first time; and\n              learning to use a straw. She recounts her first job in a factory, including learning\n              to use sewing machines and being fined for being late to work before becoming\n              accustomed to time clocks. She describes numerous attempts at organizing by\n              unspecified unions in the factories in which she worked and her decisions to find new\n              work when these attempts failed. She recounts working at the Triangle Shirtwaist\n              Factory for one day before the fire in 1911 and describes the general darkness in the\n              factory, the locked stairwells, and the fact that there was no drinking water for the\n              workers.

She recounts\n              meeting her husband at her brother's restaurant on Rutgers Street in the Lower East\n              Side neighborhood of Manhattan, where other workers would meet; learning about labor\n              unions and the Workmen's Circle through her husband; and joining the Workmen's Circle\n              once they were married.

This interview covers Herbert Sherman's childhood in Kolomea, Galicia,\n              Austria-Hungary; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1921; and his life and\n              work as a lawyer in New York, New York. Sherman begins by describing his childhood in\n              Kolomea, noting that his father immigrated to Canada in 1913 and from there to the US\n              in 1914. He explains that the prolonged absence of his father strengthened the\n              relationship he had with his mother, a well-educated woman who inculcated in him the\n              desire to get an education, and the impact of her death when he was 16 years old. He\n              recalls that Kolomea was on the border between Russia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire\n              and, as a result, the town was often in the middle of border disputes. He explains\n              that his father sent for the family at the end of World War I, but they were unable to\n              immigrate to the United States until 1921. He discusses organizations that aided\n              immigrants upon arrival in the United States, particularly the Hebrew Immigrant Aid\n              Society and living conditions on the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. He\n              recounts attending public school in New York, noting that the school had special\n              classes to teach immigrants English. He explains that he began working while he was\n              attending Seward Park High School in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, varnishing\n              sample cases for salesmen and preparing and delivering lunches to workers in a\n              manufacturing company.

He recalls meeting his wife at a holiday\n              party; their wedding in 1936; and their moves to the East Flatbush neighborhood of\n              Brooklyn and the Bayside neighborhood of Queens. Sherman explains that he became a\n              cantor at the chapel in Fort Totten in Queens, which prompted him to establish a\n              synagogue and Jewish community center in the Bay Terrace neighborhood of Queens. He\n              emphasizes his involvement in politics, noting his involvement in the Robert F. Wagner\n              Club; his support of various political candidates during the last 10 to 15 years; and\n              his desire for the the young generation at the time of the interview to develop\n              political acumen and a desire to participate in politics.

This interview covers Alex Sirota's working life, his union activity, and\n              his early life in Romania. Sirota discusses his membership and work as an organizer in\n              an unspecified furniture workers' union and the affiliation of that union with the\n              Furniture Workers Industrial Union in 1936. He describes the creation of the United\n              Furniture Workers of America (UFWA) in 1937 and the affiliation of his local with\n              them. He describes his work to unionize the factory at which he worked for the UFWA; a\n              26 week strike that followed the unionization of that factory; and he and his daughter\n              being threatened by representatives of his employer. He describes the ethnic and\n              racial demographics of the original membership of the UFWA (predominantly Jewish) and\n              the membership at the time of the interview (predominantly black and Puerto Rican). He\n              recounts meetings of the general membership being conducted and recorded in Yiddish,\n              with the minority learning Yiddish in order to participate. He discusses cultivating\n              certain workers to be union officers; officers continuing to work in the shops as an\n              officer's salary was not enough to live on; and this leading to officers having a\n              better understanding of the needs of the general membership. He discusses the union\n              leadership at the time of the interview being paid a substantial salary and not having\n              to continue working in the factories, which he felt led to a separation of the\n              leadership from the general membership and inferior management of the union.

She describes growing up in Harlem and\n              specifically focuses on living in racially mixed areas, both on 125th Street and 127th\n              Street. She explains the impact this had on her education experience, noting that the\n              first school she attended, Public School (PS) 43, was a predominantly white school,\n              where the teachers treated her well, but she often fought with other students when\n              they called her racial slurs. She recalls that when she transferred to PS 157, she\n              expected to be treated fairly because there were more black students, but they\n              ostracized her because she lived in a white neighborhood, which prompted fights with\n              them. Smith recounts her mother not understanding her aggressive reaction to racial\n              slurs and attributes this to her being accustomed to such treatment due to growing up\n              in Virginia. She recounts her mother's time in Virginia and her experience migrating\n              to New York; her mother's job as a chambermaid near Columbia University in Manhattan;\n              the difference in the ways in which lighter and darker skinned black people were\n              treated; and her experience at church and Sunday school.

The volume fluctuates and sometimes cuts\n              out before resuming after a few seconds. This interview covers Stackhouse's childhood\n              in Rippon, West Virginia; her migrations to Maryland, New Jersey, and New York; and\n              her work as a domestic employee, cook, and factory worker. Stackhouse begins by\n              describing her childhood in Rippon, West Virginia, noting that she had a tight-knit,\n              self-sufficient family. She explains that the black community accounted for half of\n              the population in Rippon and notes that race relations were relatively cordial despite\n              segregation in the town. She discusses the history of parts of her family;\n              descriptions of where each of her sisters settled; her family's domestic work for and\n              relationship with the Long family in Rippon; and religious and secular holidays and\n              traditions."

She describes moving to Baltimore, Maryland and living with her\n              sisters on Madison Avenue near Druid Hill Park. She recalls different families for\n              whom she worked; her cleaning responsibilities; her ability to create her own\n              schedule; and leaving one employer because of her racist attitude. She discusses\n              working in a department store, a job she found better than domestic work because of\n              its health benefits and worker's compensation. She discusses the stigma associated\n              with domestic work; her and her family's living and working conditions during the\n              Great Depression; dating practices in Baltimore during the 1930s and 40s; the way in\n              which she met and married her husband; and the limited job opportunities available to\n              the black population in the 1940s."

She describes other industries in which she\n              worked, including as a cook at the Rainbow Room at 30 Rockefeller Center in Manhattan;\n              a packer in a garment factory; and as a saleswoman in Macy's. She notes that she\n              enjoyed these jobs more than domestic work because they had less restrictions and\n              allowed her to meet a wide variety of people. She recalls having to adjust her work\n              schedule after her son was born in 1952, giving up her job at Macy's to take care of\n              him when she was unable find a reputable babysitter. Other topics include her\n              husband's employment as a presser in the garment industry and his work for Con Edison;\n              the ways in which women raised families and navigated discriminatory practices at\n              work; a comparison of life in a city and in the country; a comparison of life in the\n              southern and northern United States (US); the typical sequence of a family's migration\n              from the southern to the northern US; and her frequent visits to her remaining family\n              in West Virginia."

The interview covers Yetta Stein's early life in\n              Vienna, Austria-Hungary; her immigration to the United States (US); her marriage; her\n              working life; and her union activity. Stein recounts the rape and pillage by Russian\n              troops in Nadvirna in the Polish region of Austria-Hungary during World War I and the\n              fact that this led her family to flee to Vienna. She describes her life in Vienna as\n              happy but constrained by latent anti-Semitism; the fact that she had many friends who\n              were not Jewish; and her surprise at their overt anti-Semitism once Germany annexed\n              Austria in 1938. She recounts that some of her Jewish friends and family became\n              Austrian citizens, but that she and her husband could not afford to do so, and that\n              this saved their lives as the Nazis had no authority over Polish citizens at that\n              time. She recounts deciding to immigrate to the US in 1938 with her daughter; her\n              husband staying in Vienna as he had no family in the US to sponsor his immigration;\n              and the year her husband spent alone in Vienna destroying his mental health.

She explains that she was advised by the National Council of Jewish\n              Women to move to St. Louis, Missouri so that she and her husband could learn trades\n              without having to be members of a union. She describes their apartment in St. Louis\n              and how happy she was there. She recalls that she and her husband both joined the\n              International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) in St. Louis. She recalls that\n              the ILGWU helped her find work in a factory in New York City, where she worked for the\n              next 22 years. She describes how much she enjoyed working in the factory; that she\n              liked both the work and her co-workers; and that she made many friends there, both\n              Jewish and West Indian. She describes how important working outside the home was for\n              the women at the factory and the pride they took in their work. She explains the\n              different jobs in the factory; how they were divided between men and women; and the\n              different pay schedules across these jobs. Transcript and index are available for this\n              interview."

The location is likely\n              the Council Workshop for Senior Citizens in Manhattan, New York. The first name of the\n              narrator is not stated. The interview covers Mrs. Sunderman's life in Germany, her\n              immigration to the United States (US), her family, and her life at the time of the\n              interview. Sunderman recalls her early life in Frankfurt, Germany, including her\n              education. She recounts that both of her parents worked in the family's hosiery store\n              and that their leisure time was spent with other members of the family. She describes\n              her life in Frankfurt before and during World War I. She recounts her decision to send\n              her daughter to the US in 1936 after it became clear there was no future for Jews in\n              Germany. She recalls her immigration to the US in 1940; how free she felt upon her\n              arrival in New York, New York despite how hard she had to work; and that she was glad\n              to have her daughter, other family, and friends nearby. She discusses her life at the\n              time of the interview, including continuing to work as a seamstress at the age of\n              93."

He discusses the relationships among factions within and outside of\n              the organization; the relationship between the people and the police; Tamovitz's\n              arrest; and his brother's involvement in the Bund.

He describes the development of an unspecified miners' union in the\n              Pennsylvania town where he settled; the impact John Mitchell and the miners' unions\n              had on working conditions; and the decline of mining, which forced workers into other\n              industrial occupations and trades.

The interview covers Benny Terranova's childhood, his family,\n              his working life, and his union activity. Terranova discusses his childhood; his\n              education; his father's insistence that he leave school at age 14 to help in the\n              bakery; and his father's indulgence of his children. He discusses becoming interested\n              in organizing his father's bakery as a member of an unspecified Italian bakers' union;\n              working to organize other local bakeries; and becoming disillusioned with the\n              industry. He recounts his decision to become a longshoreman; his first jobs as a\n              longshoreman; and unsafe conditions on the waterfront. He recounts alternating between\n              working on the waterfront and in the bakery for four years before switching to working\n              as a longshoreman full time after seeing the work of the International Longshoremen's\n              Association (ILA) to improve working conditions. He discusses the frequent strikes\n              organized by the ILA and how these led to steady increases in wages in the 1940s and\n              early 1950s. He describes the different jobs he held on the waterfront and his rise\n              through the ranks, from working in the holds of the ships to being a superintendent\n              working in an office. He discusses officials of the ILA, in particular Anthony\n              Anastasio and Joseph Ryan. He describes the ethnic and racial demographics of the\n              longshoremen in New York; the organization of ILA locals along racial and ethnic\n              lines; and difficulties in organizing different racial and ethnic groups into one\n              local. He discusses the issues he felt were most important for longshoremen at the\n              time of interview, including health and safety and improvement of pensions."

Other people can be heard conversing in\n              the background. This interview covers Lizziemae Thompson's childhood in Wilson, North\n              Carolina; her migration to New York, New York; her work in Montefiore Hospital in the\n              Bronx; and her involvement in Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees\n              Union. Thompson begins the interview by describing her childhood in Wilson, including\n              her grandmother's plantation and the education and occupations that her siblings\n              pursued. She explains that she worked as a children's caretaker for multiple summers,\n              noting that the family she worked for would go to Montauk, New York in order to visit\n              the children's father, who was in the Navy. She notes that these visits inspired her\n              love for New York and prompted her to move to the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan\n              with her husband and children in 1949. Thompson briefly describes working as a\n              substitute teacher for Public School 68 in the Bronx, New York and another unnamed\n              school but notes that she went to work at Montefiore Hospital in 1959 in order to\n              acquire better wages and more stable work."

Thompson describes the\n              environment at Montefiore, noting the hierarchy of hospital employees; the issues and\n              hazards of working with the hospital food trucks; the tight-knit community formed in\n              the dietary department; and the ways her department's delegates aided other hospital\n              departments.

He explains that although his particular\n              battalion did not experience racial discrimination, black soldiers in other regiments\n              reported such treatment. He recounts being discharged from the Army in 1919 and\n              settling in Boston, noting few black residents in the area.

This interview covers Tony Torres' migration from Puerto Rico to New York,\n              New York, and his work in haberdasheries and a bakery. Torres mentions that he, his\n              mother, and his brother migrated to the New York, New York in 1918 in search of better\n              economic opportunities. He describes being sent to a series of orphanages after his\n              mother died during the influenza epidemic in 1918. He notes that while he did learn\n              English in the orphanages, he also lost his native Spanish while living there and\n              mentions that the orphans tended to stick together regardless of their nationality.\n              Torres explains that he worked various odd jobs until he found stable work in a\n              haberdashery, emphasizing how specific trades were usually associated with specific\n              social networks or ethnic groups. He describes getting a job at a bakery through the\n              newspaper; joining an unspecified bakers' union (likely the Journeymen Bakers Union of\n              New York); being elected shop steward; and enduring a seven month strike for better\n              wages and work hours. He notes that, at the time of the strike, the union was composed\n              of mostly independent locals that kept to themselves whereas, at the time of\n              interview, the locals presented a more united front within the industry.

He notes the lack\n              of organization and leadership in the Puerto Rican population, which he believes\n              contributed to their lack of a political presence, particularly in New York City.\n              Other topics include the relationships between different immigrant populations where\n              he lived and worked; New York City politics, predominantly focusing on Fiorello La\n              Guardia and Vito Marcantonio; the surge in Puerto Rican migration to the United States\n              in the 1940s; Puerto Rican involvement in politics; the development of labor unions,\n              with emphasis on the inclusion of immigrant and minority groups; the mechanization of\n              bakery work and its impact on bakers; his leisure time activities; and a comparison\n              between the importance of religion to his generation of Puerto Ricans and younger\n              generations."

This interview covers Primo Tossio's childhood\n              in Rome, Italy; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1926; and his work as a\n              longshoreman in New York, New York. Tossio describes his childhood in Italy, noting\n              that his education was cut short when his father fell ill and he had to work in order\n              to support his family. He recounts immigrating to the US illegally in January 1926;\n              arriving in Baltimore, Maryland; and being assisted by local Italians on his way to\n              New York. He describes his job as a longshoreman; his work in both Brooklyn and Staten\n              Island; and the difficulty of loading ships due to the organizational work that\n              accompanied it. He recounts joining an unspecified union (likely the International\n              Longshoremen's Association); gaining a greater sense of job security; moving into\n              management positions including hatch foreman and superintendent; and sending most of\n              his salary to his family in Italy. Tossio focuses on the relationship between the\n              workers and the stevedore, noting that the stevedore was paid more money. He explains\n              that the stevedore would not hesitate to fire someone whom he felt was not working\n              hard enough and that he maintained a small group of favored workers whom he\n              consistently employed."

Unger begins by\n              describing her childhood in Austria; her father's remarriage after her mother's death;\n              his death, which left Unger with her stepmother, who was soon unable to care for her;\n              and her movement among a series of relatives, one of whom physically abused her. She\n              describes returning to Vienna to attend high school; meeting her husband in a\n              coffeehouse; and emphasizing her stepmother's disapproval in the difference in their\n              ages. She recalls renouncing her religion for her husband and enduring a protracted\n              court battle to sever her stepmother's guardianship over her. She explains that her\n              husband's wealth was seized by the state as funds for World War I (WWI); her poverty\n              during WWI; her immigration to Russia in 1917 after her husband was drafted into the\n              Austrian Army and stationed there; and their illegal immigration back to Austria in\n              order to avoid the Russian Revolution."

She recalls being\n              frightened by the amount of brick houses in the US, thinking that these buildings were\n              all jails, and living in a house with steam heat, a luxury reserved for the rich in\n              Austria. She notes that she was able to acclimate more easily to the US than her\n              husband; quickly finding work as a domestic worker; renting a hotel in New Hampshire\n              during one summer so that she could set up her own Viennese restaurant; struggling to\n              find consistent employment; and teaching her husband English so he could become a\n              chauffeur. She recalls visiting her brothers-in-law in Brodhead, Wisconsin and\n              Rockford, Illinois in 1934 and 1935 and her husband encouraging her to help them grow\n              their business. Unger discusses opening another restaurant on 280 Greenwich Street in\n              Lower Manhattan, where she worked as the chef and manager while her husband worked the\n              cash register and washed the dishes. She recalls food shortages during World War II\n              forcing them to close; finding work as a pattern-maker and later department head at\n              McCall's; working with the pantograph machine; and disguising patterns sent to England\n              so the company could avoid taxes. Other topics include her interactions with the local\n              authorities and the mafia in New York City; her trips to Austria and other European\n              countries; her husband's illnesses and death; her health; and her volunteer activities\n              after her retirement."

                                        "Text": "This interview was conducted by Eric Perkins on May 21, 1973. The narrator and\n              location of this interview are unknown. The narrator of this interview does not\n              provide any information about himself. This interview covers the reasons for black\n              migration within the United States (US); the history of black sociopolitical\n              movements; and the living and social conditions of black populations in northern\n              cities in the US. The narrator describes reasons black families would migrate from the\n              southern US to the north, including a boll weevil infestation that severely damaged\n              the cotton crop during the 1920s; the repression of minorities in the south; better\n              education opportunities in the north; positive accounts from relatives; the economic\n              opportunities created by the decreased immigration from Europe during World War I; and\n              the idealistic mythology surrounding the north. He recounts the ways in which racial\n              segregation in the south gave rise to a black middle class that worked toward\n              fulfilling the needs of the black community. He elaborates on different sociopolitical\n              movements that occurred between the Civil War and the time of the interview, noting\n              that each of these developments assigned importance to different aspects of black\n              life. He discusses Garveyism, the Tuskegee movement, the Niagara movement, and the\n              development of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Topics\n              relating to these movements include the liberation of black people; the immigrationist\n              movements; the development of the foundation of a strong black economy; and the legal\n              struggles for social and political equality. The narrator focuses on the logistics of\n              the typical migration, including how a single family member, usually a young man,\n              would establish the living and financial situation before the rest of the family\n              moved. He explains that black families typically settled in what he referred to as the\n              black belts of the city, crowded areas with poor living conditions that were\n              eventually alleviated by public housing projects. Other topics include the\n              exclusionary tendencies of labor unions, which led to black employees developing their\n              own unions, especially for unskilled labor; the differences between the older and\n              younger generations' forms of leisure and entertainment, and the differences between\n              white and black families with the extended family playing a much larger role in black\n              families."

These excerpts cover the effect the Wagner\n              Act had on unionization and strikes; types of union leadership positions; the impact\n              of technology on certain industries; methods employers used to circumvent union\n              workers' demands and prevent non-union workers from joining the union; methods that\n              union workers used to disrupt strikebreakers; and a comparison of unions in the past\n              and at the time of the interviews. The interviews cover the way in which different\n              groups participated in and interacted with the union. The narrators discuss different\n              aspects of strikes including their successes and failures; the types of conditions\n              that prompted strikes; and the impacts strikes had on working conditions."

This interview covers Uttaro's\n              childhood in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US); and his life in Boston,\n              Massachusetts, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and New York, New York up to the time of the\n              interview. Uttaro describes his childhood and young adult life as being influenced by\n              liberal politics, recounting listening to Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta speak in\n              his hometown and how he developed a strong dislike for rules and organization. He\n              describes immigrating to the US as a way to become independent of his family,\n              particularly of his father's strict household rules. He recalls his first moments in\n              the US as frightening, describing how a stranger had to help him locate his cousin in\n              Somerville, Massachusetts after he got off the train in Boston. He recounts his life\n              in Pittsburgh with his sister; his return to Boston; and his dual responsibilities as\n              a presser working in a tailor shop during the day and as a student at night. He\n              describes his work as a presser as being seasonal and having to find various other\n              jobs during the off-season. He recounts marrying his wife in 1924; moving to New York\n              by himself in 1927 to pursue better employment opportunities; and sending for his\n              family a few months later. He notes that he had no desire to become an American\n              citizen until his son became upset about admitting at school that his father was not a\n              citizen, and that doing so ostracized him from some of his Socialist friends. He\n              describes becoming a member of both the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union\n              (ILGWU) Local 89 and the Industrial Workers of the World, detailing the growth of the\n              ILGWU despite tension between the Socialists and Communists within the union.\n              Throughout his interview, Uttaro emphasizes the practicality of compromise, noting\n              that even though he was an active member of the union and a Socialist, he tended to\n              criticize his affiliates when he believed they were pursuing their ideals to extremes.\n              He discusses taking part in a program through the union in which he visited older\n              union members who lived alone after he retired at age 65."

This interview covers Frank Wagner's\n              childhood in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan; his work as a delivery\n              boy, machinist, track worker, and bedding maker; and his union activity. Wagner begins\n              by describing his childhood, noting that his mother's sister raised him and his\n              siblings after his mother died. He explains that he lived in a railroad flat on 235\n              East 80th Street in the Upper East Side and recounts having frugal meals and fighting\n              with other children over broken boxes that were used as fuel for the stove. He notes\n              that he started working at nine years old in various jobs, including newspaper and\n              grocery delivery boy. He discusses he and his siblings' education; his time playing\n              baseball; and the demographics of his neighborhood. "

He recalls a nine\n              month strike that occurred in 1921 when he finished his apprenticeship, noting that\n              the strike failed due to strikebreakers brought in from England and the IAM declaring\n              the strike unauthorized. He describes working briefly for the New York Central\n              Railroad as a track worker before working in the bedding industry and joining the\n              Bedding, Curtain and Drapery Workers Union Local 140 of the United Furniture Workers\n              of America. He explains his involvement in both the industry and the union by covering\n              topics such as the industry's filthy factory conditions; his participation in strikes\n              in 1932 and 1934; his work in negotiating better pay and more holidays for Local 140's\n              members; his time as an elected union officer in 1945; and his time as unofficial\n              president of the union from 1947 to 1951. Other topics include his activity in\n              politics, specifically in an unspecified Democratic club; his time on the education\n              committee of the IAM; his memories of hiding in local community members' houses in\n              order to avoid the police during the machinists' strike of 1921; his love of playing\n              pool; and his wife, who immigrated to the US from Germany in 1929."

This interview covers Walters' childhood in\n              Saint Kitts; her immigration to the US;, her marriages and children; and her working\n              life, predominantly as a nurse in Jersey City, New Jersey; Fort Benning, Georgia; and\n              Brooklyn. Walters begins by briefly describing her childhood in Saint Kitts, noting\n              that she lived with her grandparents, aunt, uncle, and sister; and that her\n              grandfather owned his own land. She discusses her immigration to the US in 1917,\n              including making herself appear older in order to board the ship; enduring the eight\n              day voyage alone; and being unable to eat much. Walters describes settling in Jersey\n              City with her mother and stepfather, who were the superintendents of a 60 family\n              apartment building, and how she started working rather than continuing her education.\n              She explains that she got her first job working as a telephone operator in her\n              apartment building and was later hired as a nurse for the children of the Lerner\n              family in Jersey City. Walters explains that the Lerners and their staff treated her\n              like family, and that the chauffeur and chef took a particular interest in her. She\n              recounts meeting and marrying a chauffeur from Virginia in 1922, noting that she\n              separated from him when he lost his job during the Great Depression and had no\n              inclination to find another one.

This interview covers Mr. Walters'\n              childhood in Jamaica; his immigration to the United States (US) when he was 19 years\n              old; and his life and work in the construction industry in New York, New York. Walters\n              begins by describing the reason his family immigrated to the US, noting that his\n              family moved primarily due to economic conditions. He explains that many of his\n              relatives had already immigrated to the US and some of his immediate family and\n              distant relatives followed his family after their immigration. He notes that the\n              family made sure to help any new members adjust to life in the US. He recalls\n              attending an unspecified vocational school at which he learned carpentry, and working\n              in the construction industry as a carpenter and mechanic. He recalls working on the\n              George Washington Bridge, Madison Square Garden, The Daily News Building, the subway\n              in Queens, and schools near the City College of New York. He joined an unspecified\n              construction workers' union in New York City, which he remembers specifically for its\n              assistance in reducing working hours. Walters lived in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood\n              of Manhattan and noticed that, while he felt safe in his neighborhood, there was a\n              divide between the white and black populations. He emphasizes the role of the\n              sanitation workers in New York City, explaining that he believes that they are more\n              important than the police because they keep the city clean. He notes that while\n              gangsters have consistently been a problem in New York City, narcotics have made the\n              generation coming of age at the time of the interview more violent and destructive\n              than their predecessors. Other topics include his family's religion; a comparison of\n              the relevance of the church in the past and at the time of the interview; the\n              importance of a construction worker's tools; his experience during the Prohibition\n              era; racial and ethnic segregation and discrimination in New York City neighborhoods;\n              his leisure time in a book club; and a comparison of New York City in the past and at\n              the time of the interview."

The interview covers Angelina Wanderling's working life, her\n              union activity, and her family. Wanderling discusses her early work experiences in\n              garment factories, including not enjoying section work because of the repetition, and\n              looking for better jobs. She discusses her attempts at organizing factories in which\n              she worked and the opposition she met from immigrant workers who were afraid to lose\n              their jobs. She describes herself as aggressive and dissatisfied with the poor working\n              conditions in the factories, but understanding the hesitation of the other workers.\n              She recounts a strike in 1932 and 1933 led by the International Ladies' Garment\n              Workers' Union (ILGWU) in which she convinced her co-workers to participate; one\n              factory where workers had not joined the strike and her decision to disconnect the\n              factory's electricity; and the benefits the ILGWU gained for them after the strike.\n              She discusses her work as the chairlady in the factory, in particular convincing\n              management that the work involved more than sewing and that workers' examination of\n              the garments and adaption to new styles should be included in their salary. She\n              discusses her decision to leave and return to the workforce at different times, the\n              types of work she performed, and the salaries she received. "

The interview covers\n              Jean Weiner's childhood in Bessarabia, Russia; her family's life after their\n              immigration to the United States (US); her working life; and her union activity.\n              Weiner describes the daily life of her family in Bessarabia in great detail, including\n              specifics on her father's tailoring business; the food her mother would prepare for\n              the family; how her mother made extra money while her father was in the US; and the\n              importance her father placed on education. She describes the different types of\n              apartments the family rented as they moved into better apartments in the Lower East\n              Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York before being able to afford a private house\n              on Vermont Street in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn. She recounts that the\n              family had boarders; that her many relatives would frequently visit; how she enjoyed\n              having so many people in the house; and that family and friends would help each other\n              in times of need or illness. She compares the way the family lived in Russia to their\n              life in the US, describing the variety of meat that was available in the US; the way\n              the family shopped for food and goods, mainly from pushcarts on Rivington Street in\n              the Lower East Side; and the different status levels amongst the working class in both\n              countries, which were determined by a person's profession. She recounts her working\n              life, which began soon after she arrived in the US; how much money she was expected to\n              contribute to the household; the division of labor between men and women; and the fact\n              that there were certain jobs that only men could do.

She describes in great detail the chairwoman of her local, whom she\n              describes as well-educated, radical, and a Socialist. She discusses deciding to take a\n              vacation from work as she had enough money to do so and spending the summer with her\n              mother and siblings in Huntington, Connecticut; she and her sister flirting with young\n              men in front of a country store near their camp; and meeting her husband through one\n              of these men. Other topics include the family's more secular life in the US; the\n              Jewish street gang, The Little Augies; life in Jewish neighborhoods in New York City;\n              and pride in her ability to work so that her youngest brother and sister were able to\n              graduate high school and attend college."

The interviewer and location are unknown. The\n              interview covers Helen Taub Weinstein's childhood in Austria-Hungary; her family's\n              immigration to the United States (US); her family's religious beliefs; her encounters\n              with anti-Semitism in Austria-Hungary and the US; and her personal life. Weinstein\n              describes her childhood outside of Krakow and the resort her parents owned there. She\n              describes Franz Joseph I's lenient attitude towards the Jewish population, in\n              opposition to the majority of the population of Austria-Hungary. She recounts her\n              family's decision to emigrate due to rising anti-Semitism in 1911 or 1912. She\n              discusses the family's resort in Monticello, New York and her work there. She recalls\n              teaching Polish at the school in Monticello and being paid in fruit and vegetables as\n              she did not have a teaching license. She discusses the difference in religious\n              observance between her parents' generation and her own and the anti-Semitism her\n              children faced in school in Queens and Long Island. She describes the loneliness she\n              feels as an older person isolated from her family and the devastation she felt over\n              the death of her oldest son during World War II."

She\n              recalls that despite the racial segregation in the schools and churches, children were\n              generally friendly with one another. She describes working as a baby nurse for a\n              family in Jamaica, noting that they treated her like family; deferred to her on\n              matters regarding their children; and introduced her to politicians and other friends\n              of theirs. She discusses the differences between life in the city and in the country;\n              the different roles of men and women in both the household and society; the finances\n              of her household; Catholic traditions, including holiday services and the role of\n              godparents; and other secular traditions, particularly birthdays and festivals."

She explains that while her cousins helped her to acclimate to\n              life in New York, she had difficulty adapting to the winter weather. She describes\n              working as a baby nurse for various families in New York City, recalling that after\n              her marriage in 1948, she only took jobs that did not require her to live with her\n              employers. She describes her work and training as a nurse's aide at the Jewish Home\n              and Hospital for the Aged in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan. Williams\n              recalls joining Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union in 1963 or\n              1964 and notes that despite her initial skepticism of its benefits, the union gave\n              hospital workers greater job security and wage increases. Other topics include the\n              differences between her work as a baby nurse and nurse's aide; her siblings'\n              education, careers, and families; her husband's occupation and family; her\n              interactions with and impressions of union leaders, particularly Doris Turner and Leon\n              Davis; her involvement in the West Indian and American Friendly Society and St. John's\n              Lodge; and her visits to Jamaica to see her family."
